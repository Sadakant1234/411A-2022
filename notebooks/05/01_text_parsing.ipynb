              "'Financial Reform and the Importance of a Decentralized Banking Structure\\nAs always, it is a pleasure to address this convention of the Independent Bankers Association of America. This is the sixth year I have addressed this convention, and during that time four separate Congresses have debated how best to reform the financial system. I last spoke to you about financial reform in 1994, in Orlando, and it is clear that the real world occurrences of the past three years have not diminished the relevance of those words. Therefore, I shall reemphasize some of those thoughts today in the context of legislative proposals that are now before the current Congress.\\nLet me begin by reiterating the essential thrust of the Federal Reserve\\x92s position regarding financial reform. We believe that any changes, either in regulation or legislation, should be consistent with four basic objectives: (1) continuing the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) limiting systemic risk; (3) contributing to macroeconomic stability; and (4) limiting the spread of both the moral hazard and the subsidy implicit in the safety net. My remarks today will focus primarily on the macroeconomic and risk implications of financial reform and how, in particular, such reform must enable community banks to maintain their critical role in the macroeconomy.\\nThe importance of the community bank Our banking system is the most innovative, responsive, and flexible in the world. At its core is a banking structure that is characterized by very large numbers of relatively small banks--more than 7000 separate banking organizations. This banking structure is very different from that of other industrialized nations--for example, there are less than 500 banks incorporated in England, Germany, and Canada combined. To be sure, the very largest U.S. banking organizations account for the lion\\x92s share of banking assets. Still, no one institution controls more than 6 percent of total domestic banking assets in the United States.\\nThis highly decentralized, highly diverse banking structure is almost certainly the direct result of our market economy itself. Indeed, it is revealing that the first edition of Adam Smith\\x92s Wealth of Nations was published in 1776, the year of the birth of our nation. Our market-driven economy, founded on Smith\\x92s principle of \"natural liberty\" in economic choice, and the banking structure that evolved within that economy, have proved to be remarkably resilient. During the banking crisis of the late 1980s--a crisis which was felt in banking systems throughout the world--more than one thousand U.S. banks failed. But less than a decade later, loan loss reserves and bank capital at U.S. institutions stand at their highest levels in almost a half century. Moreover, the reestablishment of equilibrium regarding safety and soundness in our banking system was accomplished without costing the taxpayers a penny.\\nTo be sure, the effects of the banking crisis, as well as the ongoing pace of consolidation within the industry, have reduced the total number of banking organizations by more than a third since 1980. Nevertheless, we remain a nation characterized by a large number of smaller community banks--just as we are a nation characterized by a diversity and small average size of our nonfinancial businesses. Moreover, one cannot easily imagine nor desire that the decentralized, diverse nature of our banking system will fundamentally change any time soon. There is, of course, a strong connection between our banking structure and the nature of our small-business-oriented economy. Smaller banks traditionally have been the source of capital for small businesses that do not generally have access to securities markets. In turn, small, new businesses, often employing new technology, account for much of the growth in employment in our economy. The new firms come into existence often to replace old firms that were not willing or able to take on the risks associated with high-growth strategies. This replacement of stagnating firms with dynamic new firms--what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called the \"perennial gale of creative destruction\"--is at the heart of our robust, growth-oriented economy.\\nIt is this freedom to take on risk that characterizes our economy and, by extension, our banking system. Legislation and regulation of banks, in turn, generally should not aim to curtail the predilection of businesses and their banks to take on risk--so long as the general safety and soundness of our banking system is maintained. As I have said many times, regulators and legislators should not act as if the optimal degree of bank failure were zero. Rather, policymakers must continually assess the tradeoff between, on the one hand, protecting the financial system and the taxpayers, and on the other hand, allowing banks to perform their essential risk-taking activities, including the extension of risky credit. Optimal risk-taking on the part of our banks means that some mistakes will be made and some institutions will fail. Indeed, even if a bank is well-managed, optimal risk-taking means that such a bank can simply get unlucky. Either through mistakes of management or through the vagaries of economic luck, bank failure will occur, and such failure should be viewed as part of a natural process within our competitive system.\\nJust as regulators and legislators must accept failure, they also must not, in their zealousness to maintain a safe and sound financial system, artificially restrict competition among banks or between banks and their nonbank counterparts. For example, we should not repeat the experiment with \\x93micromanagement\\x94 of bank activities that was embodied in the 1991 FDICIA legislation, much of which was repealed in the 1994 banking legislation. In this regard, so long as we do not place artificial regulatory roadblocks in their way, I am not overly concerned with the ability of our smaller banks to compete with their large, regional or national counterparts. Our research shows that, when a large bank enters a new market through acquisition of an existing smaller institution, typically lending to small businesses initially declines. But then existing community banks take up the slack by lending to the borrowers spurned by the larger organization. Indeed, several community bankers have commented that they welcome the entry of large institutions into their markets via the acquisition route, seeing it as an opportunity to acquire some of the customer base that often is lost by the newly acquired bank.\\nThe dual banking system and the importance of choice of federal regulators Just as our decentralized banking structure is a key to the robustness of our macroeconomy, a key to the effectiveness of our banking structure is what we term the dual banking system. Our system of both federal and state regulation of banks has fostered a steady stream of innovations that likely would not have proceeded as rapidly or as effectively if our regulatory structure were characterized by a monolithic federal regulator. For example, the NOW account was invented by a state-chartered bank. Also, the liberalization of prohibitions against interstate banking has its origin in the so-called \\x93regional compacts\\x94 that permitted interstate affiliations for banking companies in consenting states. Adjustable rate mortgages are yet another example of innovation at the state level that has benefitted financial institutions and their customers.\\nJust as important as the fostering of innovation is the protection the dual banking system affords against overly rigid federal regulation and supervision. The key to protecting against overzealousness in regulation is for banks to have a choice of more than one federal regulator. With two or more federal regulators, a bank can choose to change its charter thereby choosing to be supervised by another federal regulator. That possibility has served as a constraint on arbitrary and capricious policies at the federal level. True, it is possible that two or more federal agencies can engage in a \\x93competition in laxity\\x94--but I worry considerably more about the possibility that a single federal regulator would become inevitably rigid and insensitive to the needs of the marketplace. So long as the existence of a federal guarantee of deposits and other elements of the safety net call for federal regulation of banks, such regulation should entail a choice of federal regulator in order to ensure the critical competitiveness of our banks.\\nThe job of a banking regulator, difficult under any circumstances and for a variety of reasons, is especially critical as it regards the connection running between banking risk and the impact of such risk-taking on the macroeconomy. As I have been pointing out, the historic purpose of banks is to take risk through the extension of credit to businesses and households--credit that is so vital to the growth and stability of the economy. But this fact creates a significant conflict for banking regulators. On the one hand, regulators are concerned with the cost of bank failure to the taxpayer and the impact of such failures on the general safety and soundness of the financial system. On the other hand, banks must take risks in order to finance economic expansion. Decisions about tradeoffs must be made. In the early 1990s, we saw how, in response to FDICIA, new regulations, weakened capital, and large loan losses, banks reduced their willingness to take risks, thereby contributing to a credit crunch and slower economic growth. This recent episode demonstrates clearly how tricky are these tradeoffs between necessary risk taking and protecting the banking system; a swing too far in either direction can create both short-term and long-term difficulties.\\nA regulator without responsibility for macroeconomic growth and stability tends to have a bias against risk-taking. Such a regulator receives no praise if the economy is functioning well, but is criticized if there are too many bank failures. For such a regulator, the tradeoffs are one-sided and, if the decisions of such a regulator were left unchecked, the result might be a stagnant economy at whose core was a stagnant banking system. In contrast, the Federal Reserve\\x92s economic responsibilities are an important reason why we have striven to maintain a consistent bank regulatory policy, one that entails neither excessive tightness nor ease in supervisory posture. The former would lead to credit crunches, the latter, with a lag, would lead to excessive bank failures.\\nJust as the probability of bank failure should not be the only concern of the effective regulator, bank regulation is not the only, or even the most important, factor that affects the banking business. The condition of the macroeconomy also has something to say about your success as a banker. In that regard, the generally favorable macroeconomic conditions we have been facing for the past few years suggest that bankers should now take pause and reassess the appropriateness of their lending decisions. Mistakes in lending, after all, are not generally made during recessions but when the economic outlook appears benevolent. Recent evidence of thin margins and increased nonbank competition in portions of the syndicated loan market, as well as other indicators, suggest some modest underwriting laxity has a tendency to emerge during good times. This suggests the need for a mild caution that bankers maintain sound underwriting standards and pricing practices in their lending activities.\\nToward financial reform without losing the strengths of our current system Let me now turn from general concerns over our regulatory structure to more specific concerns regarding the supervisory and regulatory treatment of our largest, most complex banking organizations--a subject in which I suspect community banks have some considerable interest. As the 105th Congress contemplates financial reform legislation, it is critical to focus on the issue of how best to supervise risk-taking in these large entities and, in particular, whether there should be significant umbrella supervision for the entire banking organization.\\nHistorically, bank holding companies have been largely confined to financial activities that are similar to, often the same as, those permissible to commercial banks. Also historically, supervision of banking organizations, both large and small, has tended to focus mainly on the need to protect the bank. To some extent, this emphasis on the bank rather than the nonbank activities of the banking organization was prompted by, or permitted by, management techniques that tended not to treat risk-taking in integrated fashion across the entire holding company. The regulators\\x92 main concern was the bank, and bank safety could be analyzed more or less remotely and distinctly from the nonbank activities of the banking organization.\\nMore recently, the focus of supervision of holding companies by the Federal Reserve is being modified to parallel the changes in the management of banking companies. Most large institutions in recent years have moved toward consolidated risk management across all their bank and nonbank activities. Should the Congress permit new nonbanking activities by banking organizations it is likely that these activities too would be managed on a consolidated basis from the point of view of risk-taking, pricing, and profitability analysis. Our regulatory posture must adjust accordingly, to focus on the decision-making process for the total organization. Especially as supervisors focus more on the measurement and management of market, credit, and operating risks, supervisory review of firm-wide processes increasingly will become the appropriate principle underlying our assessment of an organization\\x92s safety and soundness.\\nSome market participants--especially nonbanks contemplating buying banks in the wake of any new Congressional legislation, as well as banks contemplating entering newly permissible nonbank activities--are naturally concerned over the thought of bank-like regulation being extended to their nonbank activities. We share this concern, and last month we asked Congress to modify our mandate to permit the Fed to be more flexible on such issues as applications for new activities. At the same time, however, we believe there has been some considerable misunderstanding of our basic philosophy of holding company supervision. The focus of the Fed\\x92s inspections of nonbank activities of bank holding companies is to gain a sense of the overall strength of the individual units and their interrelations with each other and the bank. As I indicated above, emphasis is placed on the adequacy of risk management and internal control systems. Only if there is a major deficiency in these areas would we intend for a bank holding company inspection to become in any significant way \\x93intrusive,\\x94 and the number of such intrusive inspections of nonbanking activities should be quite small if managements are following prudent business practices.\\nSome observers have questioned not only the need for umbrella supervision, but also the need for the Fed\\x92s involvement in such supervision. In addition to the reasons I cited above for central bank involvement in supervision, there is the issue of systemic risk and the fact that it is primarily the Federal Reserve\\x92s obligation to maintain stability in our financial system and that system\\x92s interface with international financial markets. This obligation cannot be met solely via open market operations and use of the discount window, as powerful as these tools may be. Financial crises, when they occur, are unpredictable and diverse in nature. Globalization means that a domestic crisis can become international or that a foreign crisis can become a domestic concern. The Federal Reserve\\x92s ability to respond quickly and effectively to any particular systemic threat rests primarily on our experience and expertise with the details of the U.S. and foreign banking and financial systems, including our familiarity with the payments and settlement system. This expertise, in turn, has been accumulated over the years primarily through our supervision of large domestic and multinational banking companies, and via our participation in large payments and settlement systems which are such a critical part of our financial infrastructure.\\nIn order to carry out our responsibility, the Fed must be directly involved in the supervision of banks of all sizes--such as now provided by member banks--and must also be able to address the problems of large banking companies if one or more of their activities endanger the stability of our financial system. This implies that the Federal Reserve have appropriate supervisory authority. Moreover, the new regulatory structure must retain our flexibility to respond to changes in the structure of the financial system, especially where such changes cannot easily be forecast in the wake of significant legislative changes. Systemic crises occur very rarely by their very definition. But when such crises do occur the consequences of slow or misdirected action are grave. The central bank, as the lender of last resort, must have the knowledge, the tools, and the authority necessary to act in a timely and decisive fashion. This is necessary to protect the whole financial system, not the least of which are the critical players among our community banks.\\nConclusions Let me conclude by reiterating two of the Federal Reserve\\x92s most basic concerns as the current Congress deliberates the issue of financial reform. First, we should recognize the increasingly evident fact that financial firms of all sorts now engage routinely in a wide variety of financial activities that, just a few decades ago, were considered to be nontraditional. Even in cases where the financial activity is currently not permitted directly, the risks and returns of the activity can be mimicked through the prudent use of financial derivative instruments such as put and call options. We should recognize these facts and, in response, structure legislation that would permit the full economic integration of these various forms of financial activity, in order to gain the maximum operating efficiencies, the best tradeoffs between risk and return, and the most flexibility in meeting the needs of the customer. But new legislation should not attempt to accomplish too much too soon. The Board believes it is prudent to delay, or to implement in stages, broad authorization of nonfinancial activities for banking companies. We want to be sure of the smooth functioning of integrated financial activity before we address potential combinations of banking and commerce.\\nSecond, in permitting broadened financial powers, legislation should strive to maintain the current roles of both the dual banking system and the central bank. Financial reform should not be interpreted to mean regulatory reform for its own sake. Banks of all sizes must have their regulatory choices preserved, just as financial firms of all sizes should be permitted to engage prudently in a wide range of financial activity. Finally, the central bank must continue to be able to monitor and address activities of large banking organizations that might threaten the stability of the system. I am confident that prudent, reasoned financial reform can be accomplished in a manner that preserves the best of the current system while introducing the improvements that we all desire. Thank you very much.\\n1997 Speeches Home | News and events Accessibility | Contact Us Last update: March 24, 1997 9:00 AM'"

            "Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan Bank supervision, regulation, and risk At the Annual Convention of the American Bankers Association, Honolulu, Hawaii October 5, 1996\n",
            "\n",
            "You may well wonder why a regulator is the first speaker at a conference in which a major theme is maximizing shareholder value. I hope that by the end of my remarks this morning it will be clear that we, the regulators, share with you ultimately the same objective of a strong and profitable banking system. Such a banking system knows how to take and manage risk for profit. The problem is what, if anything, regulators should do to constrain the amount of risk bankers take in trying to meet their corporate objectives. I have given considerable thought to this issue over the years, and today I would like to address this theme once again.\n",
            "\n",
            "I. The Changing Nature of Bank Supervision and Regulation At the outset, it is critical to understand some key unintended implications of the safety net--our system of deposit insurance, payment guarantees, and discount window credit. First, since the safety net makes bank creditors feel safer, the banking system is larger, more stable, and more able to take risk and extend more credit than otherwise would be the case. In the process, banks have contributed significantly to the economic growth of the nation and continue to do so.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, since deposit insurance premiums do not, and probably cannot, vary sufficiently with risk, the disconnect between bank portfolio risk-taking and a bank's cost of funding has made necessary a degree of regulation and supervision that would be unnecessary without the safety net. That is, since the market signals that usually accompany excessive risk-taking are substantially muted, regulators are compelled to act as a surrogate for market discipline.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, our preoccupation with prudential risk-taking has added to the pressures put on the entire banking and regulatory structure by technology and globalization. Many of the activities that banks feel are necessary responses to these market pressures are either prohibited by statute or constrained by regulation because of our concerns about exposing the safety net to unacceptable risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "These implications of the safety net highlight the dilemma of the regulator. How do we avoid killing the goose that lays the golden egg--an innovative and flexible banking system--without either exposing the taxpayer to excessive potential cost or the financial system to excessive systemic risk?\n",
            "\n",
            "The answers to this question are critical. First and foremost, as I have indicated many times before, the optimal failure rate in banking is not zero. Risk-taking means that failures will occur, and, moreover, if we did not permit risk-taking, and therefore the possibility of failure, the banking system would not be in a position to foster economic growth. The banking system would shrink because it would be unable to carry out its underlying economic function.\n",
            "\n",
            "While failures will inevitably occur in a dynamic market, the safety net--not to mention concerns over systemic risk--requires that regulators not be indifferent to how banks manage their risks. To avoid having to resort to numbing micromanagement, regulators have increasingly insisted that banks put in place systems that allow management to have both the information and procedures to be aware of their own true risk exposures and to be able to modify such exposures. The better these risk information and control systems, the more risk a bank can prudently assume, although higher risk positions generally will require larger loan loss reserves and higher capital.\n",
            "\n",
            "I might also note that risk management standards are increasingly an important supplement to traditional supervisory techniques. The use of new technology and instruments in rapidly changing financial markets means that some balance sheets are already becoming historical artifacts that are not even necessarily indicative of risk exposures of the next day. In such a context, the supervisor must rely on his evaluation of risk management procedures as a supplement to--and in extreme cases, in lieu of--balance sheet facts. As the 21st century unfolds, the supervisors' evaluation of safety and soundness, of necessity, increasingly will be focused on process, and less on historical records.\n",
            "\n",
            "Well-functioning risk management systems are necessary, but not sufficient, for taking on greater risk. Banks must also have the capital resources to absorb the inevitable losses that result from risk-taking and still remain solvent. Thus, banks are required to maintain both reserves consistent with expected losses and capital sufficient to absorb the vast majority of unexpected losses that experience and data suggest could occur, but whose timing and size are not predictable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Determination of appropriate capital levels is not just a regulatory concern. Increasingly, bankers are treating the determination of proper capital levels as integral to the meeting of shareholder goals. Shareholder value is maximized, almost surely, when long-run risk-adjusted return on equity is maximized. One method of quantifying the risk-adjusted return is to measure returns--net of expected losses--against the capital that should be allocated to a transaction to reflect that transaction's risk. As I will discuss in more detail shortly, some bankers are doing exactly that: quantifying risks, allocating sufficient capital to cover those measured risks, and then trying to focus on those lines of business for which risk-adjusted returns to allocated capital are the highest. It does not matter whether the bank concentrates on low-risk, low-capital business, or on high-risk, high-capital business, only that it concentrates on businesses for which it has a comparative advantage, that is, businesses that earn an above-average rate on its internally allocated capital, after provisions for expected losses. Regulators, in my opinion, should take notice of this emerging business philosophy-- for a bank that properly measures its risks and allocates capital to those risks is well on its way to being a safe and sound bank, as well as one that meets its shareholders' objectives.\n",
            "\n",
            "II. Implications of Technology for Shareholder Value and for Regulatory Policy Many observers have commented on the increasing complexity of financial instruments and transactions. However, these complexities would not have been possible in actual market circumstances without the technological advances that also allowed these risks to be measured and managed. Indeed, as I noted earlier, banks can now quantify the dimensions of risks for instruments and transactions that we could only conceptualize a short time ago. Consider just two examples of what risk quantification permits today: securitization and the day-to-day control of market risk in a portfolio of complex derivative contracts. In both of these cases, risk quantification is a prerequisite to informed risk-based pricing. Moreover, the comparison of the risk-based price to current market conditions is critical to management decisions regarding withdrawing, cutting back, or expanding a bank's endeavor in specific credit markets.\n",
            "\n",
            "A critical component of risk-based pricing, as I noted earlier, is the determination of an appropriate internal allocation of capital to the individual credit subportfolios. For internal management purposes, banks for some time have been grouping their credits by risk class, modifying the classification of individual credits periodically. Now, banks on the frontier are using historical data and advanced modeling techniques to determine formal estimates of probable losses for each loan classification. Some of these banks have gone one step further, using these risk estimates to estimate the amount of capital that management should allocate against various loan classifications for internal pricing and other resource allocation purposes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The widespread adoption of these techniques lies in the future, but, as I suggested earlier, some forms of risk quantification are now being used by banks to enhance shareholder values. Unfortunately, some bankers believe that new technologies, such as credit scoring, and the growth of some activities, such as securitization, will reduce their franchise values by driving down spreads. Indeed, the new technologies can be viewed as chipping away at banks' specialized knowledge of the local loan customer. In effect, barriers to entry are lowered when the new technologies allow nonlocal competitors to offer standardized products through nationwide marketing campaigns using, for example, toll-free 800 telephone numbers. On the other hand, the byproducts of these new technologies include lower underwriting expenses and the more accurate estimation of probable losses. These byproducts act to offset the effects of increasing competition created by the new technologies, both by raising profits on existing operations and by opening up opportunities with customers previously not served. Better and more quantifiable estimates of risk are tantamount to risk reduction.\n",
            "\n",
            "More generally, and of much greater importance, rapidly changing technology is broadening and deepening financial markets while inevitably enhancing competitive pressures. In one sense this trend has been with us since the industrial revolution, but it has clearly accelerated in recent years in banking markets. Because the hot hand of competition is always putting pressure on us, we in our darker moments wish it would just go away. I very often succumbed to such melancholy when I was in the private sector. But we are wrong. Competition is the force which keeps us on our toes, makes us better and more productive, and creates higher market values for our banking institutions, just as it does for other firms. Competition is what has raised our standards of living for generations and made this nation the world's preeminent economic power.\n",
            "\n",
            "Technological change and the accompanying competition are irreversible, and those banks unwilling or unable to adapt to them will lose market share and suffer lower risk-adjusted rates of return. But the banks that embrace the cost-cutting and risk-reducing effects of the technology will, in my judgment, tend to find it a rewarding experience. Scale is not an issue. Small banks can now purchase the software that will permit them to use the new procedures, and upstream correspondents and others will be there to buy the product.\n",
            "\n",
            "III. Regulatory Innovation Technological change is not the sole province of the private sector. Regulators too must adapt to the new technology, and, in this regard, some important lessons are being learned. For example, the private sector, for a considerable time, has been accustomed to product planning cycles in which the planning of the replacement product is begun, if not well along, by the time a new product is being introduced. Similarly, regulators are beginning to understand that the supervision of a financial institution is, of necessity, a continually evolving process reflecting the continually changing financial landscape. This is not a fault but rather a description of an appropriate regulatory process. Indeed, given our own long lead times, we must begin designing the next generation of supervisory procedures even while introducing the latest modification, much as you are forced to do for your own products.\n",
            "\n",
            "Increasingly, the new supervisory techniques and requirements try to harness both the new technologies and market incentives to improve oversight while reducing regulatory burden, burdens that are becoming progressively obsolescent and counterproductive. This is becoming especially true in evaluating the capital adequacy of banks. One example is the recent decision by regulators to use internal model approaches for measuring market risks at banks and allocating regulatory capital to those risks. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has been studying an alternative capital allocation process for market risk, the so-called pre-commitment approach. This methodology would provide market and other financial incentives for banks to choose their own capital allocations for trading risk that they believe are consistent with their own risk management capabilities as well as with regulatory objectives.\n",
            "\n",
            "The range and extent of securities powers permissible for bank holding companies is another area where the Federal Reserve has attempted to modify its regulations to parallel changing market realities. As you know, beginning in 1987 the Federal Reserve allowed increased securities powers in so-called section 20 subsidiaries. Most recently, based on our favorable experience with these subsidiaries, we have proposed dismantling some of the limitations and restrictions that, in an abundance of caution, we originally imposed to constrain risk exposures of the insured bank affiliate. Both that favorable experience and the changing structure of financial markets suggested that these modifications were desirable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Similarly, both changing markets and our experience suggested the need to streamline the bank holding company application process and related provisions. Accordingly, in August the Board requested comment on a wide ranging revision to its Regulation Y. You will note that the expedited application procedures were proposed only for strong and well-managed entities that we believe, by definition, need less oversight. This, too, is a simulation of the way the market would treat such financial institutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, both the section 20 and Regulation Y examples illustrate another major problem in the current banking environment. Both areas are still constrained by outdated and increasingly inefficient statutes. Indeed, statutory provisions ultimately limit the Fed's ability to relax section 20 or Regulation Y limits. Fundamental congressional reform of the Glass-Steagall and the Bank Holding Company acts is still needed.\n",
            "\n",
            "IV. Conclusion If banks were unregulated, they would take on any amount of risk they wished, and the market would rate their liabilities and price them accordingly. Ideally, banks should also face regulatory responses to their portfolio risks that simulate market signals. And these signals should be just as tough as, but no tougher than, market signals in an unregulated world. Perfection would occur if bankers had a genuinely difficult choice deciding if they really wanted to remain an insured bank or become an unregulated financial institution.\n",
            "\n",
            "While awaiting perfection, it is useful to underline that regulators and banks have a common interest in using the evolving new technologies to meet their own separate objectives: maximizing shareholder value and maintaining a safe and sound banking system. One cannot be done without the other. And as you increasingly apply these new technologies, we will be replacing our procedures with those that depend increasingly on risk management, risk quantification, market simulations, and--within the confines of law--reduced barriers. Our \"best practice\" is to assure that regulatory restrictions are not a barrier to your \"best practice.\" Your \"best practice\" is to employ improved risk management and all its tools in order to increase your risk-adjusted rate of return. If you succeed in doing that, bank shareholders, the financial system in general, and our economy as a whole will all be better off.\n",

            "The Transformation of the U.S. Banking Industry and Resulting Challenges to Regulators\n",
            "\n",
            "Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here on Ohio Bankers Day. The over-riding theme of my remarks is the profound transformation the banking industry has undergone over the last 15 years or so and the challenges that these changes pose to bank regulators. At the end, I hope to have time to take some questions and learn where you think the banking industry is going, and how--consistent with our responsibilities--regulators can promote a more efficient, resilient, and profitable financial services industry. I plan to learn as much or more from you as you learn from me.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Role of Banks Let me begin with a few observations about the importance of the banking industry in the economy and why banking receives such special attention in terms of regulation. Banks, like other financial intermediaries, pool and absorb risks for depositors and provide stable sources of investment and working capital funds for nonfinancial industries. Banks also provide a unique mix of services among all financial intermediaries, including a \"safe haven\" for small, unsophisticated investors through insured deposits, an important source of funds for small borrowers who often have limited access to other sources of external finance, a smoothly functioning payments system that allows financial and real resources to flow relatively freely to their highest-return uses, a conduit for monetary policy, and a backup source of liquidity for any sector in temporary difficulty through its access to the discount window.\n",
            "\n",
            "Throughout all the changes of the past, and through all the changes to the banking industry in the foreseeable future, banks will continue to perform these important functions, and a goal of bank regulators is to make sure that there is a healthy banking industry to do so.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Rationale for Bank Regulation But there are two particularly important characteristics of the banking system that demand our attention as regulators--indeed, are critical to understanding why there are bank regulators. First, banks have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance, the discount window, and payment system guarantees. This gives the government a direct stake in keeping bank risks under control, just like a private insurance company has a stake in controlling the risks of policyholders. Because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately priced, it is necessary for us to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect the potential call on taxpayers. It is also important to understand that an unintended consequence of the safety net is that it creates or augments incentives for some banks to take additional risks. That is, the safety net creates moral hazard incentives to gamble because the safety net--and potentially taxpayers--may absorb most of the losses if the gamble fails. Deposit insurance gets in the way of the depositors signaling a bank when it takes excessive risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second characteristic of banks that requires the special attention of regulators is that banks are capable of being the conduits of systemic risk and crisis in financial markets. A breakdown of the payments system or other contagion effect that hampers the ability of banks to intermediate credit flows could have serious adverse consequences for the economy, again requiring the special attention of regulators to bank risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "The challenge is to strike a balance in regulation so that, on the one hand, taxpayers are protected, extensions of the safety net are avoided, and moral hazard incentives are mitigated without, on the other hand, undermining the competitiveness of the banking industry and its ability to take risk, and therefore damaging the entity the regulators are trying to protect.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Evolution of Bank Regulation Although this rationale for bank regulation has not changed, in the last decade and a half there has been a significant evolution in approach of regulators toward maintaining the safety and soundness of the banking industry. From the 1930s through most of the 1970s, regulators focused on keeping the banking industry safe and sound by protecting banks from competition and by limiting the activities in which they could participate. This meant, for example, prohibiting interstate banking, restricting the rates that banks could pay on deposits, and preventing commercial banks from competing in other product markets, such as investment banking. During this period, the financial services industry was segmented into separate entities providing commercial banking, investment banking, insurance services, etc. This separation was largely due to legislative and regulatory decisions. A consequence of the separation was that firms in each segment of the financial services industry were protected from competition from firms providing the other services.\n",
            "\n",
            "Starting in the late 1970s, the changed economic environment along with advances in technology, financial innovations, and globalization resulted in increased competition to U.S. banks by thrifts, nondepository financial institutions, foreign banks, and the capital markets. Higher and more variable interest rates, and the accompanying increased yield sensitivity of depositors and borrowers, contributed to the development of money market mutual funds as alternatives to bank deposits and the growth of finance companies and commercial paper as substitutes for bank loans. The increase in external competition brought a swift response from both banks and their regulators.\n",
            "\n",
            "Banks responded to the challenge by expanding in ways that they could, also taking advantage of improvements in technology and applied finance. They expanded their roles as intermediaries through off-balance-sheet activities such as securitization, back-up lines of credit and derivatives, and, in the process, substituted fee income for some of the interest income lost through competition with other financial intermediaries. In addition, banks sought expanded powers to help them compete, including being able to cross state borders, set their own deposit rates and account types, and--by the late-1980s--expand into securities underwriting activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regulators responded to the new environment by reducing the regulatory burden on banks and allowing them to compete on a more level playing field with nonbanking firms. That is, the new market realities required a reorientation in emphasis from protecting banks from competition to giving banks the opportunity to compete not only with other banks but with nonbank competitors as well. By allowing banks to enter other states, set their own prices, and engage in other than traditional banking activities, the orientation of regulators evolved toward protecting the safety net while allowing banks to deliver financial services to the public efficiently, profitably, and with sufficient capital to be protected against unforeseen events.\n",
            "\n",
            "Structural Change in the Banking Industry As a result of this process of structural change, the banking industry of the mid-1990s in many ways hardly resembles that of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of the major changes that I want to focus on are the increased consolidation of the industry, the decline in traditional banking services as a result of increased outside competition, the expansion in bank powers, including the move into nontraditional activities to offset the competition for their traditional products, the increased emphasis on risk management in response to the increased complexity of financial instruments and practices, and the evolution of capital standards and capital positions to keep abreast of the changing risk profiles of banking organization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consolidation in the banking industry One of the most obvious and dramatic changes is the consolidation of the banking industry. The number of independent banking organizations--by which I mean top-tier holding companies plus unaffiliated banks--has shrunk by more than one-third since the late 1970s, from more than 12,000 to fewer than 8,000. The percentage of banking assets controlled by organizations with more than $100 billion has about doubled, and is now close to a fifth of all U.S. banking assets, while the percentage of banking assets in banking organizations with less than $100 million in assets has dropped by half, from about 14 percent to 7 percent of industry assets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Much of the consolidation is a direct outgrowth of the removal of geographic restrictions on bank branching and holding company acquisitions by the individual states, a process that is now being extended by the Reagle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branch Efficiency Act of 1994. This deregulation encourages the banking industry to become more efficient at serving the public’s needs by allowing the efficient competitors to succeed and manage more of the industry’s resources. The banking industry has also become stronger through the geographic diversification of risks made possible by interstate banking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Importantly, the interstate expansion of large banks does not mean the end of small banks. Past experience has consistently shown that when large banking organizations enter a new local market by acquisition, the existing small banks that are efficient can compete successfully and maintain their market shares and profitability. We fully expect thousands of small banks to remain in business even after nationwide branching is fully implemented.\n",
            "\n",
            "The emergence of, and response to, increased outside competition: a decline in traditional banking and the growth of nontraditional activities Over the last 15 years, there has also been a substantial increase in competition to the U.S. banking industry from capital markets, less-regulated domestic financial institutions, and foreign institutions. As a result, U.S. banks have lost substantial market shares of many of the asset and liability categories that were the mainstay of traditional banking. However, these declines in market share for banks in traditional product lines do not suggest that the banking industry itself is in decline. After factoring into the analysis the rapid expansion of nontraditional off-balance-sheet activities, research suggests that the banking industry continues to grow, although not as fast as financial markets as a whole. The banking industry, for example, has grown at about the same rate as GDP and the new products of the banking industry--such as derivative contracts and other off-balance-sheet activities--have skyrocketed.\n",
            "\n",
            "The most important indicators of whether the banking industry is in decline--measures of financial performance--are even more positive. The banking industry is profitable, able to raise capital in financial markets, and has a relatively high market-to-book ratio. These performance indicators also suggest that resources will continue to flow into the industry, rather than out of the industry. The evidence taken as a whole suggests that the banking industry is weathering the increase in outside competition and is competing well against it.\n",
            "\n",
            "The expansion of bank powers The powers of banking organizations also grew dramatically over this time period in two different ways. First, in the early 1980s, the Monetary Control Act gave banks the right to set their own deposit interest rates and offer new types of accounts, such as household transactions accounts that paid market-based interest rates.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another major way in which banking organization powers expanded over this period was the increase in the number of banking activities permitted to nonbank affiliates of bank holding companies. Regulators allowed bank holding companies to enter more and more product markets over this time period. Bank holding companies can now have separately capitalized subsidiaries that offer investment advice, provide discount brokerage services, and underwrite both debt and equity securities, albeit under restricted circumstances. The market also played a large part in blurring the old distinctions between banks and nonbanks, as other financial services companies began to offer more products with characteristics close to those of bank deposits and loans. Again, the regulatory shift in orientation was in large part a reaction to the market--banks were given more power to compete with nonbanks in part because nonbanks were figuring out better ways to compete against banks.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is also notable that over time banks have taken much greater advantage of the powers they already had. As I mentioned earlier, banks greatly increased their use of off-balance-sheet guarantees to follow some of their loan customers who chose to borrow their funds elsewhere, and banks were also active players in the new derivative products of the 1980s and 1990s.\n",
            "\n",
            "Increased emphasis on risk management and the growing importance of market risk Despite these many changes, the core business of banking has remained the measurement, acceptance, and management of risk, although a number of important developments over the last 15 to 20 years have improved the abilities of banks to perform these functions. The most notable developments are in the area of market risks. Derivative contracts such as futures and swaps are essentially new lines of business for banks in the last decade and a half, which allow banks to measure, accept, and manage market risks to a much greater extent than in the past.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the 1970s, banks primarily measured, accepted, and managed the credit risks of illiquid loans and dealt little with market risks other than minimal asset-liability duration matching. The rapid developments in market risk tools have facilitated an expansion of the core business of banking to put an increased emphasis on market risks, but banks are nonetheless still primarily in the same core business of measuring, accepting, and managing risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, it is important to recognize that having access to improved risk management technologies does not necessarily make banks safer. Despite the improvements in the abilities of banks to understand and control risks, the risks of the institutions themselves ultimately also depend importantly on the incentives of bank managers and owners to control risks, and on the economic environment in which they operate. There is little benefit, and perhaps net costs, in having a bank manager know how to measure, accept, and manage risks accurately if this ability is used to take excessive risks that are largely borne by the federal safety net and potentially by taxpayers. Similarly, when the economic environment turns against bank investments, many banks will become risky and some will fail, even if they have managed their risks fairly well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Return to top The source of the large number of bank failures in the 1980s and the dramatic improvement in the health of the banking system in the 1990s These caveats are well illustrated by comparing the circumstances of U.S. banks in the 1980s versus the 1990s. During the 1980s, bank failures were increasing, and by the end of the decade banks were failing at the rate of about 200 per year. Even greater problems were experienced by the savings and loan industry. These problems have been largely attributed to two factors.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, when banks or savings and loans get into very low or negative capital positions, the moral hazard problem I discussed earlier may become more severe. There is a possibility of purposely taking on additional risks to gamble their way out of trouble. When there is little capital at risk, the owners get much of the benefits if the gamble pays off, and the safety net and taxpayers bear most of the losses if the gamble fails.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, the 1980s saw a number of turbulent economic changes. These included fluctuations in interest rates and inflation rates, swings in the prices of commercial real estate and junk bonds that could not be easily forecast, and regional recessions that caused significant numbers of problem loans. These changes caused damage at many financial institutions, particularly those in geographically undiversified positions without sufficient capital to protect themselves.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given the poor condition of many banks as late as 1991, it is amazing how healthy the banking industry is now, having written off most of its bad assets, raised large amounts of capital, and returned to profitability, likely having its fifth straight year of record profits in 1996. Bank failures have now retreated to at or near single digits per year. Clearly, this turnaround is too rapid to be completely accounted for by technical and financial innovations in the measurement, acceptance, and management of risk, or by improvements in the diversification and capitalization of banks. Changes in attitudes toward risk taking brought about by the higher capital standards and other factors, and changes in the economic environment have also played important roles in the improved health and wealth of the banking industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "The evolution of capital standards and capital positions The final development I will discuss is the evolution of the financial capital positions of U.S. banks, since capital is the cornerstone of defense against bank risks. Capital serves two functions in this regard. First, it helps improve the incentives of banks to keep their own risks under control, reducing moral hazard incentives to take those risks that are largely imposed on others. Second, capital is a buffer stock available to absorb risks and economic shocks without creating bankruptcy costs and systemic problems associated with the failure of financial institutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "A goal of capital requirements--along with bank supervision and quality risk management by the banks themselves--is to make the safety net a moot issue for most banks. That is, by having enough capital available to absorb potential losses and having both the bank and supervisor carefully monitoring and acting to control portfolio risks, the moral hazard incentives of the safety net and the vulnerability of the deposit insurance funds can be kept to a minimum. It is similarly true that the more we can do to keep risk to the safety net under control using capital and other tools, the more powers we can safely grant to banks without placing undue stress on the safety net or meaningfully expanding safety net protection to other activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the end of the 1970s, capital regulation was relatively ad hoc and depended largely on the judgment and discretion of the individual bank’s supervisors. Starting in 1981, regulations required banks to hold capital equal to a flat percentage of their balance sheet assets. The next refinement was based on Basle Accord risk-based capital standards--adopted in 1988 and implemented starting in 1990--requiring banks to hold different amounts of capital depending on the perceived credit risk of different on- and off-balance-sheet assets. In addition, to reduce discretion in the enforcement of the standards and the closure of capital-impaired banks, Congress included \"prompt corrective action\" provisions in the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Under prompt corrective action, or PCA, banks with capital ratios below certain threshold values are subject to increasingly severe mandatory and discretionary sanctions. Finally, risk-based capital standards which originally only covered credit risks are now being extended to cover market risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "The process by which the new market risk standards were arrived at is indicative of the new orientation toward incentive-based regulation, allowing well capitalized, efficient banks to compete and imposing costs more selectively on undercapitalized, poorly managed banks. The standards also permit banks that are more efficient at monitoring and controlling their risks to hold less capital than inefficient banks. These regulatory standards are much like what the market would do in the absence of the safety net. The new standards, which apply to banks with substantial trading, allow banks to use their own internal models of risk that are employed in their everyday operations to determine the capital requirements on their trading books. This approach also reflects a new effort to develop refinements in regulatory standards in cooperation with the industry, in part by better understanding the \"best practices\" that are evolving in the industry and using these as a basis for regulatory standards across the industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "A cumulative effect of the many changes in capital regulation in the 1980s and early 1990s, as well as other factors, is that banks have much higher capital ratios today than they did 15 years ago, and even 5 years ago. This is especially true at the largest banking organizations. For the banking industry as a whole, the equity-to-assets ratio rose from less than 6 percent at the end of the 1970s to over 8 percent in the mid-1990s. For the largest banking organizations, the capital ratio rose from less than 4 percent to over 7 percent.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Implications of the Transformation of Banking for Bank Regulation We should not be too sanguine about bank capital, however. While the current capital standards are significant improvements over what they replaced, they are still based on broad one-size-fits-all rules. Moreover, the market has begun to focus more on the capital-risk trade-off: no large bank or parent banking organization, for example, has AAA long-term debt, and only a handful are rated AA, despite the capital ratios I just quoted. Banks at the cutting edge are risk rating their loan portfolios and internally allocating capital to them for management and profitability analysis. Such allocations are superior ways of developing capital allocation for individual banks. Perhaps we will be able in the future to harness banks’ internal capital allocations for regulatory purposes. Indeed, the reason for choosing the topics I have discussed thus far is that these structural changes represent an on-going process and are going to continue to challenge us in the future. In the final portion of my remarks, I will try to identify some of the most important challenges that regulators will face as a result of these changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Maintaining local competition in the face of continued bank consolidation First, with regard to future banking industry consolidation, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 essentially expands the existing regional compacts to the nation as a whole, and overturns the McFadden Act prohibition on interstate branching. Interstate branching to almost all the states is permitted as of June 1, 1997. The removal of these artificial barriers to trade is beneficial and will likely improve efficiency and diversification of risks in the banking industry.\n",
            "\n",
            "The exact future structure of the banking industry is unknown, but presumably will be driven not just by the removal of legal barriers to competition, but by shifts in technology, efficiency, and risk diversification. The firms with the greatest managerial efficiencies are expected to take over those with the lowest efficiencies and improve them. Research in banking suggests that these differences in managerial efficiency are much larger than any scale and scope economies. Various models predict that several thousand banking organizations are likely to disappear under nationwide banking, but that the remaining banks will still number in the thousands, as small community banks that serve their constituents well are likely to remain in business.\n",
            "\n",
            "There appear to be two key challenges to regulators regarding consolidation. The first is to be sure that there is adequate competition from banks and nonbanks in local banking markets. Research has suggested that high local market concentration leads to prices that are unfavorable to bank customers--low deposit rates for retail depositors and high loan rates for small business loans. High concentration may also lead to reduced managerial efficiency, as the price cushion provided by market power allows a \"quiet life\" for managers in which relatively little effort is required to be profitable. Insuring an adequate amount of local-market competition is essential to avoid these potential problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second challenge brought on by consolidation is to make sure that mergers and acquisitions do not create excessive risks. In this regard, it is important that capital be sufficient to cover any problems during the transition period when the banks and systems are learning to work together, on top of the normal risks of ongoing operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "The interaction of bank powers and bank structure The future expansion of banking organization powers also raises some challenges to regulators. Indeed, financial reform will likely be a high priority of the next Congress, perhaps including repeal of Glass-Steagall. One of the results of financial reform, along the lines of the bill Congressman Leach introduced last session, would be the emergence of financial services holding companies that could include both commercial and investment banks. There is also a prospect that banks might be able to expand into insurance activities as well. This would take to a perhaps logical conclusion the recent blurring of the lines between financial services firms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Whether or not the Glass-Steagall Act is repealed, we face the challenges of insuring that the proposed recent expansion of bank powers through section 20 subsidiaries does not inadvertently expand the safety net protection afforded to banks to protect other, previously nonbank, activities. This would give an unfair subsidy to banking organizations.\n",
            "\n",
            "While there is no perfect system for allowing financial intermediaries to gain the most from the synergies of joint production while avoiding expansion of the safety net, there are several steps that seem likely to keep this problem under control. First, we need to be sure to require plenty of capital in the bank to keep the value of access to the safety net low. Second, we need to provide reasonable insulation of the bank from the risks of the nonbanking enterprises. The Board believes that the best way to do this is by placing new activities in holding company subsidiaries, rather than in the bank itself or its subsidiaries. The further the separation from the bank, the better is the insulation. A third safeguard to protect the bank and prevent the expansion of the safety net subsidy is the adoption of prudential limitations through firewalls and rules that prohibit or limit certain bank and affiliate transactions. While firewalls may temporarily bend under stress, they nonetheless serve a useful purpose. On the other hand, we must strike a balance and not make the firewalls so rigid that they would eliminate the economic synergies between the banks and their affiliates. In this spirit, the Board last month made an effort to modify firewalls to allow banks to achieve efficiency gains with respect to security underwriting in Section 20 affiliates without creating excessive risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "The issue of what bank structure is appropriate and prudent in light of expanded banking powers is a particularly controversial one. While the Board’s view that the expanded powers should be carried out only in subsidiaries of the bank holding company was incorporated into the Congressman Leach’s unsuccessful financial modernization bill in the last Congress, this preference is not shared by all parties to this debate. Some stress the costs associated with the holding company structure and question its benefits from a safety and soundness perspective and, as a result, favor either allowing the new activities to be carried out in a subsidiary of the bank itself or at least allowing banks an option with respect to structural form.\n",
            "\n",
            "Staying up-to-date in the supervision of bank risk management as financial products and practices evolve There will undoubtedly be further developments in the ways that banks perform their core functions of risk measurement, acceptance, and management as markets continue to evolve improved \"best practices\" in dealing with market and credit risks. This evolution will continue to challenge regulators to keep capital standards and other risk monitoring and control mechanisms from falling too far behind. One particular challenge is that the continued development of derivative products and other means of managing risks can also allow bank employees to take excessive risks and hide them from supervisors and perhaps from the owners of the bank. It is difficult for regulators to quantify these risks, and even more difficult to design risk-based deposit insurance and risk-based capital systems that accurately incorporate these risks.\n",
            "\n",
            "In response, regulators will need to stick with capital as the cornerstone of defense against bank risks, both to reduce moral hazard incentives and to provide a buffer stock to absorb losses. A challenge will be to continue to update the capital standards in line with current or not-too-out-of-date risk measurement techniques. Expansion of the recently implemented \"internal models\" type of approach may be helpful in this regard, using, as I noted earlier, banks’ own risk measurements to help set their capital requirements. In addition, many of the techniques used to quantify and control market risks may be transferable for use in quantifying and controlling credit risks in the future.\n",
            "\n",
            "The task of measuring capital and risks can also be made easier if bank portfolios are made somewhat more transparent. Increased transparency would also facilitate market discipline--a highly desirable goal in our rapidly changing financial environment. A problem here is that it is not always clear how to best encourage transparency. For example, partial market value accounting may involve more costs than benefits. However, it seems clear that this is an issue that will remain on our plates for the foreseeable future.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, the capital standards can and should be augmented by bank supervisors in individual cases. The risk-based capital standards and prompt corrective action rules are, and will remain, only minimum capital guidelines for normal circumstances. Supervisors need to require additional capital when banks are explicitly taking additional risks that are not captured by the guidelines, or when bank risks are excessively opaque and it is too difficult to determine if excessive risks might be undertaken. To accomplish this, it is important to continue to examine banks on a regular basis. There is simply no market substitute for the type of information that can be gathered under the auspices of a bank examination with access to the complete records of a bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, as financial transactions become more complex, supervisors cannot be expected to monitor every detail. Increasingly, supervisors will focus on banks’ risk management procedures. Banks will have to convince supervisors that they have prudent risk management procedures and policies and that the bank follows them. Increasingly, supervisors will emphasize your process of risk management and control, and proof that you are using those techniques, in order to determine whether your capital is adequate for your risk profile and procedures.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reducing the burden of regulation and increasing the uniformity in regulation across banking agencies While recent banking legislation significantly reduced the regulatory burdens on the banking industry, we all realize that keeping the costs of supervision and regulation low is an important on-going task for all parties. It is particularly important for the federal banking agencies to continue efforts at improved cooperation with each other, including standardization of certain policies and procedures and data collection. In short, we must try to reap the potential benefits of multiple regulators in terms of encouraging innovation and providing checks and balances on regulatory excess, without incurring the potential costs of \"competition in laxity\" and excessive overlap and duplication of efforts. I am optimistic that this can be done, perhaps by augmenting the role of the FFEIC.\n",

            "\n",
            "Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am especially pleased to accept AEI's Francis Boyer Award for 1996 and be listed with so many of my friends and former associates. In my lecture this evening I want to give some personal perspectives on central banking and, consequently, I shall be speaking only for myself.\n",
            "\n",
            "William Jennings Bryan reportedly mesmerized the Democratic Convention of 1896 with his memorable \". . . you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\" His utterances underscored the profoundly divisive role of money in his time--a divisiveness that remains apparent today. Bryan was arguing for monetizing silver at an above-market price in order to expand the money supply. The presumed consequences would have been an increase in product prices and an accompanying shift in the value of net claims on future wealth from the \"monied interests\" of the East to the indebted farmers of the West who would arguably be able to pay off their obligations with cheaper money.\n",
            "\n",
            "The debates, before and since, over the issue of our money standard have mirrored the deliberations on the manner in which we have chosen to govern ourselves, and, perhaps more fundamentally, debates on the basic values that should govern our society.\n",
            "\n",
            "For, at root, money--serving as a store of value and medium of exchange--is the lubricant that enables a society to organize itself to achieve economic progress. The ability to store the fruits of one's labor for future consumption is necessary for the accumulation of capital, the spread of technological advances and, as a consequence, rising standards of living.\n",
            "\n",
            "Clearly in this context, the general price level, that is, the average exchange rate for money against all goods and services, and how it changes over time, plays a profoundly important role in any society, because it influences the nature and scope of our economic and social relationships over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is, thus, no wonder that we at the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, and ultimate guardian of the purchasing power of our money, are subject to unending scrutiny. Indeed, it would be folly were it otherwise.\n",
            "\n",
            "A central bank in a democratic society is a magnet for many of the tensions that such a society confronts. Any institution that can affect the purchasing power of the currency is perceived as potentially affecting the level and distribution of wealth among the participants of that society, hardly an inconsequential issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not surprisingly, the evolution of central banking in this nation has been driven by such concerns. The experiences with paper money during the Revolutionary War were decidedly inauspicious. \"Not worth a Continental\" was scarcely the epithet one would wish on a medium of exchange. This moved Alexander Hamilton, with some controversy, to press for legislation that established the soundness of the credit of the United States by assuming, and ultimately repaying, the war debts not only of the fledgling federal government, but of the states as well. Equally controversial was the chartering of the First Bank of the United States, which, although it had few functions of a modern central bank, was nonetheless believed to be a significant threat to states rights and the Constitution itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although majority controlled by private interests, the Bank engaged in actions perceived to shift power to the federal government. Such a shift was thought of by many as a fundamental threat to the new democracy, and an essential element of what was feared to be a Hamilton plan to re-establish a powerful aristocracy. The First Bank--and especially its successor Second Bank of the United States--endeavored to restrict state bank credit expansion when it appeared inordinate, by gathering bank notes and tendering them for specie. This reduced the reserve base and the ability of the fledgling American banking system to expand credit. The issue of states' rights and concern about the power of the central government reflected the free wheeling individualism of that time. The Second Bank was a major issue of the election of 1832. Earlier in that year, President Andrew Jackson had vetoed the bill to extend its charter, and the election became a referendum on his veto. The outcome was a resounding victory for Jackson and the death knell for the Bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "It has not been easy, however, to separate often seemingly conflicting threads in the debate between advocates of state powers over money and those seeking a national role. When Andrew Jackson vetoed the charter renewal of the Second Bank of the United States, for example, he argued for the severing of the grip on the economy of easterners and especially foreigners, who owned a significant stock interest in the bank. Ironically, by helping to create what was perceived to be an unstable currency, he set the stage for the later development of a full-fledged gold standard, the institution that Bryan railed against in 1896 from much the same populist philosophical base as Jackson.\n",
            "\n",
            "After the Civil War, redemption of the paper greenbacks issued during the war brought an era of a gold-standard-induced deflation, which, while it may not have thwarted the impressive advance of industrialization, was seen by many as suppressing credit availability for the rural interests of the nation, which were still a majority. The general price level declined for more than two decades, which meant borrowers were paying off their loans in more expensive dollars than those they borrowed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not surprisingly, mounting pressures developed for reform, with Bryan bearing the standard for subsidized silver coinage, that is, free silver. Though Bryan lost to McKinley in 1896 (and again in 1900), the rural-based pressures for a more elastic currency did not diminish and ultimately were reflected, in part, in the creation of the Federal Reserve.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nonetheless, many of the proponents of banking reform in the 1890s, and in the aftermath of the Panic of 1907, were suspicious of creating a central bank. In very large measure, those concerns underlay the various threads of reform that were joined together in the design and creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. Its founding followed a prolonged debate on the balance of power between the interests of the New York money center banks and the rest of the nation, still largely rural. The compromise that resulted from that debate created twelve regional Reserve Banks with a Washington presence vested with a Federal Reserve Board. Its purpose was to \"furnish an elastic currency, . . . to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes.\" Monetary policy as we know it today, was not among the \"other purposes.\" That evolved largely by accident in the 1920s.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even with a central bank, the gold standard was still the dominant constraint on the issuance of paper currency and the expansion of bank deposits. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve was to play a minor role in affecting the purchasing power of the currency for many years to come.\n",
            "\n",
            "The world changed markedly with the advent of the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the evisceration of the gold standard. The upheaval, and still festering fear of New York \"monied interests,\" engendered the Banking Acts of 1933 and more importantly of 1935, which vested more of the Federal Reserve's authority with the Board of Governors in Washington. During World War II, and through 1951, however, monetary policy was effectively subservient to the interests of the Treasury, which sought access to low-cost credit. With the so-called Federal Reserve-Treasury Accord of 1951, the Federal Reserve began to develop its current degree of independence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although in the 1950s and early 1960s there were short-lived bouts of inflation that caused momentary concern about sustained increases in the price level, these events did little to shake the conviction of most that America's economic and financial structure would indefinitely and effectively contain any inflationary forces. This prescription certainly seems to have been reflected in the low inflation premium then embedded in long-term bonds.\n",
            "\n",
            "That this view was profoundly wrong soon became apparent. The 1970s saw inflation and unemployment simultaneously at relatively elevated levels for some time. The notion that this could occur was nowhere to be found in the conventional wisdom of the economic policy philosophy that developed out of the Keynesian revolution of the 1930s and its subsequent empirical applications. Moreover, these models embodied the view that aggregate demand expansion, from almost any level, would permanently create new jobs. When that expansion carried the economy beyond \"full employment\" there would be a cost in terms of higher inflation--but only a one-time increase in inflation, so that there existed a permanent trade off between sustainable levels of inflation and employment.\n",
            "\n",
            "The stagflation of the 1970s required a thorough conceptual overhaul of economic thinking and policymaking. Monetarism, and new insights into the effects of anticipatory expectations on economic activity and price setting, competed strongly against the traditional Keynesianism. Gradually the power of state intervention to achieve particular economic outcomes came to be seen as much more limited. A consensus gradually emerged in the late 1970s that inflation destroyed jobs, or at least could not create them.\n",
            "\n",
            "This view has become particularly evident in the communiques that have emanated from the high-level international gatherings of the past quarter century. That inflation could reduce employment was a highly controversial subject in the mid-1970s when introduced into communique language drafts. At the meetings I attended as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the notion invariably induced extended debates. Today in similar communiques such language is accepted boiler plate and rarely the focus of discussion. This shift in attitudes and understanding provided political support in 1980 and thereafter for the type of monetary policy required to rebalance the economy.\n",

With regard to monetary policy, the view--or at least the suspicion--still persists in some quarters that an activist, expansionary policy could yield dividends in terms of permanently higher output and employment.\n",

            "Nonetheless, there is a grudging acceptance of the degree of independence afforded our institution, and an awareness that unless we are free of the appropriations process that our independence could be compromised. It is generally recognized and appreciated that if the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions were subject to Congressional or Presidential override, short-term political forces would soon dominate. The clear political preference for lower interest rates would unleash inflationary forces, inflicting severe damage on our economy.\n",

There is no alternative to basing actions on forecasts, at least implicitly. It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is evident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the underlying forces acting on the economy shift. This process is not easy to get right at all times, and it is often difficult to convey to the American people, whose support is essential to our mission.\n",

To open up our debates on monetary policy fully to immediate disclosure would unsettle financial markets and constrain our discussions in a manner that would undercut our ability to function. Nonetheless, we continue to look for ways to expand the flow of information to the public without compromising our deliberations and purposes. We have recently commenced to announce all policy actions immediately (federal funds rate changes as well as discount rate changes) and have expanded the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n",

The information supplied about local conditions by the directors of the Reserve Banks has been frequently useful in identifying emerging national trends and in evaluating their underlying regional implications.\n",

Since the late 1970s, however, such concerns have become an important element in policymaking. More recently inflation has been low, but its future course remains uncertain. The development of comfortable product, but tight labor, markets has been a crucial factor in short-term economic forecasts of recent months--a phenomenon for which there is scant historic precedent.\n",

Thus, during the decades of the 1970s and 1980s, trends in money supply, first M1, then M2, were useful guides. We could convey the thrust of our policy with money supply targets, though we felt free to deviate from those targets for good reason. This presumably helped the Congress, after the fact, to monitor our contribution to the performance of the economy. I should add that during this period we maintained a fully detailed analysis of the economy, in part, to make sure that money supply was still emitting reliable signals about the state of the economy.\n",

            "There are some indications that the money demand relationships to interest rates and income may be coming back on track. It is too soon to tell, and in any event we can not in the future expect to rely a great deal on money supply in making monetary policy. Still, if money growth is better behaved, it would be helpful in the conduct of policy and in our communications with the Congress and the public. In the absence of simple, summary indicators, we will continue our detailed evaluation of economic developments. As we seek price stability and maximum sustainable growth, the changing economic structures constantly present more analytic challenges.\n",

            "When industrial product was the centerpiece of the economy during the first two-thirds of this century, our overall price indexes served us well.

            "But as the century draws to a close, the simple notion of price has turned decidedly ambiguous. What is the price of a unit of software or a legal opinion? How does one evaluate the price change of a cataract operation over a ten-year period when the nature of the procedure and its impact on the patient changes so radically. Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial and real implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?\n",
            "\n",
            "So long as individuals make contractual arrangements for future payments valued in dollars, there must be a presumption on the part of those involved in the transaction about the future purchasing power of money. No matter how complex individual products become, there will always be some general sense of the purchasing power of money both across time and across goods and services. Hence, we must assume that embodied in all products is some unit of output and hence of price that is recognizable to producers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions. Doubtless, we will develop new techniques of price measurement to unearth them as the years go on. It is crucial that we do, for inflation can destabilize an economy even if faulty price indexes fail to reveal it.\n",
            "\n",
            "But where do we draw the line on what prices matter? Certainly prices of goods and services now being produced--our basic measure of inflation--matter. But what about futures prices or more importantly prices of claims on future goods and services, like equities, real estate, or other earning assets? Are stability of these prices essential to the stability of the economy?\n",
            "\n",
            "Clearly, sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future, and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of stocks and other earning assets. We can see that in the inverse relationship exhibited by price/earnings ratios and the rate of inflation in the past. But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade? And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy? We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs, and price stability. Indeed, the sharp stock market break of 1987 had few negative consequences for the economy. But we should not underestimate or become complacent about the complexity of the interactions of asset markets and the economy. Thus, evaluating shifts in balance sheets generally, and in asset prices particularly, must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy.\n",

            "The public examination of Federal Reserve actions extends well beyond our stewardship of monetary policy. Our overall management of the Federal Reserve System should, and does, come under considerable scrutiny by the Congress. Since we expend unappropriated taxpayer funds, we have an especial obligation to be prudent and efficient with the use of those funds. I am not particularly concerned about the one-third of our annual $2 billion budget that is expended to provide financial services to the private sector in competition with other providers. Such services include the clearing of checks, the operation of the Fedwire system, and the processing of automated clearing house payments. We are reimbursed for those services, and at competitive prices still make a reasonable profit for the Treasury. If we became inefficient and uncompetitive, we would be priced out of the market, and eventually out of that line of business.\n",

We have already engaged in major consolidations of operations when such consolidations have been made cost effective by the newer technologies. Although in my experience the Federal Reserve System has been responsible, efficient, and has performed well, the rapidly changing external environment frequently requires us to rethink our role and mission. Even where we can be competitive, it is not the role of a government agency, especially one vested with an unsurpassable credit rating, to seek out all available market opportunities. Accordingly, where specific priced services have become effectively and competitively provided by private sector suppliers, the Federal Reserve needs to reassess whether the extent of our participation in those services fulfills a reasonable public purpose. There are, of course, certain services that the Congress has, and will in the future, deem appropriate for us to subsidize. But these areas presumably will remain circumscribed.\n",

This mission is an extension of our monetary policy. Our country can not enjoy the long-run \"maximum employment and stable prices\" objectives we are given for monetary policy if the financial system is unstable. In this regard, the successes that most please us are not so much the visible problems that we solve, but rather all the potential crises that could have happened, but didn't.\n",

Recent mini-crises have identified the rapidly mushrooming payments system as the most vulnerable area of potential danger. We have no tolerance for error in our electronic payment systems. Like a breakdown in an electric power grid, small mishaps create large problems. Consequently, we have endeavored in recent years, as the demands on our system have escalated (we clear $1-1/2 trillion a day on Fedwire), to build in significant safety redundancies. This has been costly in terms of equipment and buildings.\n",

Accordingly, we are endeavoring to get as close to a real time transaction, clearing, and settlement system as possible. This would sharply reduce financial float and the risk of breakdown. Meaningful progress has already been made in this direction.\n",

            "Today I would like to address an issue that almost certainly will be at the forefront of American concerns over the next decade: our largest federal entitlement program, social security.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is becoming conventional wisdom that the social security system, as currently constructed, will not be fully viable after the so-called baby boom generation starts to retire in about fifteen years. The most recent report by the social security trustees projected that the trust funds of the system will grow over approximately the next fifteen years. However, beginning in the year 2012, the annual expected costs of social security are projected to exceed annual earmarked tax receipts, and the consequent deficits are projected to deplete the trust funds by the year 2029.\n",
            "\n",
            "While such evaluations are based on an uncertain future, the benefit per current retiree under existing law, adjusted for inflation, can be forecast with some precision over the next thirty years. Somewhat less precision is possible for future retirees. The price escalation of benefits, of course, is even more difficult to pin down. But since price inflation has an equal effect on wages subject to social security taxation, for all practical purposes, the degree of inflation does not have a large direct effect on the net funding of the system over the long run. However, the rate of inflation, because it affects the overall economy, presumably does affect the real wage base from which social security taxes and future benefits are derived.\n",
            "\n",
            "The projection of inflation-adjusted taxes, which are subject to a wider degree of uncertainty than total benefits, is largely driven by real wage growth--that is, wage growth adjusted for inflation--which, in turn, is primarily determined by the growth of productivity. Projecting productivity in line with the pattern of the last quarter century suggests a trend of revenue falling far short of the levels required to finance the benefits of the large baby-boomer bulge in retirees anticipated to start at about 2010. I should state, parenthetically, that if recent productivity trends are underestimated, as I suspect they are, for much the same reasons are the projected trends of both real benefits and payroll taxes. The real future funding shortfall, therefore, would not be materially affected. Our social security problem is, thus, not merely statistical; it is the consequence of a projected shortfall in real resources dedicated to social security. In money terms, the current social security trust fund of a half trillion dollars falls far short of the levels required to fund the current obligations to pay promised benefits to those already retired and those who will retire in the years ahead.\n",
            "\n",
            "Social security, unlike fully funded private retirement programs, is largely an intergenerational transfer. Today's workers are essentially paying for today's retirees. Under the current system, the social security benefits paid to today's workers when they retire in the future will be primarily dependent upon the payroll taxes acquired from future workers. Accordingly, if the social security system is to survive in its current form, either real benefits must be curtailed, or real taxes increased. The latter can come from either higher tax rates or higher real wage growth--in effect, higher productivity growth. However, as I will be explaining shortly, higher productivity is unlikely alone to do the trick. Moreover, increased social security tax rates, of course, are controversial in that many perceive them, myself included, to adversely affect employment.\n",
            "\n",
            "A primary cause of social security's funding imbalance stems from the fact that, until very recently, the payments into the social security trust accounts by the average employee, plus employer contributions and interest earned, were inadequate, at retirement, to fund the total of retirement benefits. This has started to change. Under the most recent revisions to the law, and presumably conservative economic and demographic assumptions, today's younger workers will be paying social security taxes over their working years that appear sufficient to fund their benefits during retirement. However, the huge unfunded liability for current retirees, as well as for much of the work force closer to retirement, leaves the system, as a whole, badly underfunded.\n",
            "\n",
            "As longevity improved far beyond that contemplated by the creators of the system, and productivity growth slowed after 1973, the original premise of the system of intergenerational balance began to fail. Today the official unfunded liability for the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability funds, which takes into account expected future tax payments and benefits out to the year 2070, has reached a staggering $3 trillion.\n",
            "\n",
            "The social security trustees currently project taxes and benefits, under existing, and of necessity, quite tentative economic assumptions, that imply that fully funding social security for the next seventy-five years would require an immediate and permanent increase in social security taxes of about 2.2 percentage points of taxable payrolls on top of the current 12.4 percent tax rate, assuming that such an increase would not impede economic growth. Of course, benefit reductions of a similar magnitude, or a mix of tax hikes and benefit cuts, could also bring the system back into long-term actuarial balance, at least statistically. These types of program adjustments, which on the surface seem quite modest, might nonetheless be perceived as transforming what has until recently been a largely popular, subsidized, intergenerational transfer system into something quite contentious. Moreover, the longer action is deferred, the greater will be the necessary tax increases or, more likely, benefit adjustments required to achieve the goal of long-term actuarial balance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Clearly, something has to give. The question is what? We cannot hope to grow our way out of the problem. An immediate and sustained increase in annual productivity growth of about 2 percentage points apparently would be needed to close the long-run funding gap without an increase in taxes or a cut in benefits. The improvement in productivity growth must be this large because higher productivity raises future benefits as well as current and future tax receipts. However, given that we struggle to devise economic policies that might raise productivity growth by a few tenths of a percentage point per annum, a gain of 2 full points seems beyond the reach of credibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nonetheless, this issue does underscore the critical elements in the forthcoming debate, since it focuses on the core of any retirement system, private or public. Simply put, unless social security taxes increase, or as I just indicated, more likely, benefits are adjusted, domestic savings must increase. Potential beneficiaries must further abstain from consuming all of their incomes. Enough must be set aside over a lifetime of work to fund the excess of consumption over any non-social security income a retiree may still enjoy. At the simplest level, one could envision households saving by actually storing goods purchased during their working years for consumption during retirement. Even better, the resources that would have otherwise gone into the stored goods could be diverted to the production of new capital assets, which would, cumulatively, over a working lifetime, produce an even greater quantity of retirement goods and services. In short, we would be getting more output per worker, our traditional measure of productivity, and a factor that is central in all calculations of long-term social security trust fund financing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hence, the bottom line in all retirement programs is physical resource availability. The finance of any system is merely to facilitate the underlying system of allocating real resources that fund retirement consumption of goods and services.\n",
            "\n",
            "The basic premise of our current largely pay-as-you-go social security system is that future productivity growth will be adequate to supply promised retirement benefits for current workers. At existing rates of saving and investment this is becoming increasingly dubious. Accordingly, there are a number of initiatives, at a minimum, that will surely have to be addressed. As I argued at length in the Social Security Commission deliberations of 1983, with only marginal effect, some delaying of the age of eligibility for retirement benefits will become increasingly pressing. For example, adjusting the full-benefits retirement age to keep pace with increases in life expectancy would keep the ratio of retirement years to expected lifespan approximately constant and would help to significantly narrow the funding gap. Hopefully, other modifications to social security benefits also will be judged as necessary. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly recognized that the Consumer Price Index overstates increases in the cost of living, and thus indexing social security benefits to the CPI goes far beyond the intent of the Congress to insulate retirees from inflation. In that regard, the recently released report from the Boskin commission makes a valuable contribution to the emerging consensus on this issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, unless future taxes and/or benefits are sufficiently adjusted, there is no substitute for increased domestic savings and investment currently. To be sure, for relatively short periods of time we can finance part of domestic investment in plant and equipment with foreign savings as we are doing today. History, however, tells us that there is a limit to how far that can go. We are also apparently increasing the productivity of our capital. It is possible that the maturing of emerging technologies, and further substantial deregulation of industry and finance, will, in themselves, improve the growth rate of productivity without large capital investment and savings. But, it would take implausible improvements in capital productivity from current rates to close very much of the social security funding gap from this source.\n",
            "\n",
            "The necessary boost in domestic savings need not be derived from an improved social security system, but certainly a reduction in the social security funding gap would itself move in that direction. In a sense, it could create a virtuous cycle with higher savings engendering higher productivity growth which, in turn, would narrow the funding gap still further. Of course, additional saving can be achieved through a reduction in the overall federal government budget deficit, and intensified efforts to encourage private household and business savings.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some have argued for a provision in law to require the social security trust funds to invest in higher-yielding private securities, especially equities, rather than in U.S. Treasuries only. A higher rate of return, it is alleged, would help solve the social security funding problem. That may in fact be the case, but if so, what would happen to private retirement programs?\n",
            "\n",
            "If social security trust funds are shifted in part, or in whole, from U.S. Treasury securities to private debt and equity instruments, holders of those securities in the private sector must be induced to exchange them, net, for U.S. Treasuries. If, for example, social security funds were invested wholly in equities, presumably they would have to be purchased from the major holders of such equities. Private pension and insurance funds, among other holders of equities, presumably would have to swap equities for Treasuries. But, if the social security trust funds achieved a higher rate of return investing in equities than in lower yielding U.S. Treasuries, private sector incomes generated by their asset portfolios, including retirement funds, would fall by the same amount, potentially jeopardizing their financial condition. This zero-sum result occurs because of the assumption that no new productive saving and investment has been induced by this portfolio reallocation process.\n",
            "\n",
            "Proceeding further, one must presume that in such a circumstance, in order to induce the private sector to exchange their equities for Treasuries, equity prices must rise and bond prices fall. But, this would create great market tension. Bonds and equities are merely the paper claims to income earning assets, and the value of the income stream is not determined by short-run changes in the supply and demand for securities. Rather, equity prices must, in the long run, reflect the underlying earnings of the corporations on which the equities are a claim, as well as society's need to be compensated for postponing consumption into the future and its perception and attitudes toward risk as a consequence of uncertainty about the future. Indeed, the total market value of debt plus equities, is, to a first approximation, likely to be unaffected by a shift in the balance of paper claims.\n",
            "\n",
            "One might expect that this tension between the altered relative supply of equity and debt claims, on the one hand, and unaltered overall economic value of the nation's companies, on the other hand, would be resolved by an increase in the issuance of equity securities relative to bonds. This could reverse much, if not all, of the price shift in favor of equities. However, to complicate the issue still further, it is not clear as to whether, and to what extent, bond prices would rise as corporations cut back on debt issuance. Certainly with the social security trust funds no longer investing all of their surplus in U.S. Treasuries, the federal debt held by the public would rise, presumably placing downward pressure on bond prices. At best, the results of this restricted form of privatization are ambiguous.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, the dilemma for the social security trust funds is that a shift to equity investments without an increase in domestic savings may not appreciably increase the rate of return of social security trust fund assets, and to whatever extent that it does, would likely be mirrored by a comparable decline in the incomes of private pension and retirement funds.\n",

            "I should stress that this does not mean that at least a partial privatization of our social security system does not provide a potentially viable solution to current funding problems. There are a number of thoughtful initiatives that, through the process of privatization, could increase domestic saving rates. These are clearly worthy of intensive evaluation. Perhaps the strongest argument for privatization is that replacing the current unfunded system, which apparently discourages saving, with a fully funded system, is that such a change could boost domestic saving. But, in any event, we must remember it is because privatization plans might increase savings that makes them potentially viable, not their particular form of financing.\n",

            "The types of changes that will be required to restore fiscal balance to our social security accounts, in the broader scheme of things, are significant but manageable. More important, most entail changes that are less unsettling if they are put into effect in the near term rather than waiting five or ten years or longer.\n",
            "\n",
            "Minimizing the potential disruptions associated with the inevitable changes to social security is made all the more essential because of the pressing financial problems in the Medicare system, social security's companion program for retirees. Medicare currently is in an even more precarious position than social security. The financing of Medicare faces some of the same problems associated with demographics and productivity as social security but faces different, and currently greater, pressures owing to the behavior of medical costs and utilization rates. Reform of the Medicare system will require more immediate and potentially more dramatic changes than those necessary to reform social security.\n",

            "We owe it to those who will retire after the turn of the century to be given sufficient advance notice to make what alterations in retirement planning may be required. The longer we wait to make what are surely inevitable adjustments, the more difficult they will become. If we procrastinate too long, the adjustments could be truly wrenching. Our citizens deserve better.\n",

            "I discovered when I joined the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System about six months ago that most of my friends--including my sophisticated public policy oriented friends--had only a hazy notion what their central bank did. Many of them said, enthusiastically, \"Congratulations!\" Then they asked with a bit of embarrassment, \"Is it a full-time job?\" or \"What will you find to do between meetings?\" The meetings they were aware of, of course, were those of the Federal Open Market Committee. They knew that the FOMC meets every six weeks or so to \"set interest rates.\" That sounds like real power, so the FOMC gets a lot of press attention even when, as happened again this week, we meet and decide to do absolutely nothing at all.\n",
            "\n",
            "The group gathered here today, however, realizes that monetary policy, while important, is not actually very time-consuming. If you cared enough to come to this conference, you also have a strong conviction that the health and vigor of the American economy depends not only on good macro-economic policy, although that certainly helps, but also on the safety, soundness and efficiency of the banking system. We need a banking system that works well and one in which citizens and businesses, foreign and domestic, have high and well placed confidence.\n",
            "\n",
            "So I want to talk today, as seems appropriate on the fifth anniversary of FDICIA, about the subject that occupies much of our attention at the Federal Reserve: the prudential regulation of banks and how to improve it. Indeed, I want to focus today, not so much on what Congress needs to do to ensure the safety and soundness of the bank system in this rapidly changing world--there are others on the program to take on that task--but more narrowly on how bank regulators should go about their jobs of supervising bank risk-taking.\n",
            "\n",
            "The evolving search for policies that would guarantee a safe, sound and efficient banking system has featured learning from experience. In the 1930s, Americans learned, expensively, about the hazards of not having a safety net in a crisis that almost wiped out the banking system. In the 1980s, they learned a lot about the hazards of having a safety net, especially about the moral hazard associated with deposit insurance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Deposit insurance, which had seemed so benign and so successful in building confidence and preventing runs on banks, suddenly revealed its downside for all to see. Some insured institutions, mostly thrifts, but also savings banks, and not a few commercial banks, were taking on risks with a \"heads I win, tails you lose\" attitude--sometimes collecting on high stakes bets but often leaving deposit insurance funds to pick up the pieces. At the same time, some regulators, especially the old FSLIC, which was notably strapped for funds, were compounding the problem--and greatly increasing the ultimate cost of its resolution--by engaging in regulatory \"forbearance\" when faced with technically insolvent institutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "The lessons were costly, but Americans do learn from their mistakes. The advocates of banking reform, many of them participants in this conference, saw the problems posed by moral hazard in the context of ineffectual supervision and set out to design a better system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Essentially, the reform agenda had two main components: First, expanded powers for depository institutions that would permit them to diversify in ways that might reduce risks and improve operating efficiency; Second, improving the effectiveness of regulation and supervision by instructing regulators, in effect, to act more like the market itself when conducting prudential regulation.\n",
            "\n",
            "FDICIA was a first step toward meeting the second challenge--how to make regulators act more like the market. It called for a reduction in the potential for regulatory \"forbearance\" by laying down the conditions under which conservatorship and receivership should be initiated. It called for supervisory sanctions based on measurable performance (in particular, the Prompt Corrective Action provisions that based supervisory action on a bank's risk-based capital ratio). The Act required the FDIC and RTC to resolve failed institutions on a least-cost basis. In other words, the Act required the depository receivers to act as if the insurance funds were private insurers, rather than continue the past policy of protecting uninsured depositors and other bank creditors. Finally, FDICIA placed limitations on the doctrine of \"Too Big To Fail,\" by requiring agency consensus and administration concurrence in order to prop up any large, failing bank. In a few places, however, FDICIA went too far. The provisions of the Act that dealt with micro management by regulators were immediately seen to be \"over the top,\" and were later repealed. The Act provided a framework for regulators to invoke market-like discipline. It left room for them to move their own regulatory techniques in this direction--a subject to which I will return in a minute.\n",
            "\n",
            "The other objective of reform--diversification of bank activities through an expansion of bank powers--has not yet resulted in legislation and is still very much an on-going debate. In part, this failure to take legislative action reflected the long-running ability of the nonbank competition to use its political muscle to forestall increased powers for banks. But the inaction on expanded powers also reflected a Congressional concern that additional powers might be used to take on additional risk, which, on the heels of the banking collapse of the late 1980s, represented poor timing, to say the least. There was also some Congressional disposition to punish \"greedy bankers,\" who were seen as the reason for the collapse and the diversion of taxpayer funds to pay for thrift insolvencies. Whatever the reasons, not only did the 102nd Congress fail to enact expanded bank powers, but so did the next two Congresses. We are hopeful that the 105th Congress will succeed where its predecessors have failed. Meanwhile, the regulatory agencies have acted to expand bank powers within the limits of existing law.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Federal Reserve has proposed both liberalization of Section 20 activities and expedited procedures for processing applications under Regulation Y. The OCC has acted to liberalize banks' insurance agency powers and, most recently, to liberalize procedures for operating subsidiaries of national banks. Of course, I would have to turn in my Federal Reserve badge and give up my parking pass if I did not mention that we at the Fed believe that some activities are best carried out in a subsidiary of the holding company rather than a subsidiary of the bank. We believe that the more distance between the bank and its new, nonbank operations, the more likely that we can separate one from the other and avoid the spreading of the subsidy associated with the safety net.\n",
            "\n",
            "While the regulators can move in the right direction, it is still imperative that Congress act. Artificial barriers between and among various forms of financial activity are harmful to the best interests of the consumers of financial services, to the providers of those services, and to the general stability and well-being of our financial system, most broadly defined. Congress should consider this issue and take the next steps.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let me turn now to what I consider to be one of the most critical issues facing regulators, especially in a future in which financial markets likely will dictate significant further increases in the scope and complexity of banking activities. I am referring to the issue of how to conduct optimal supervision of banks. Fortunately, there appears actually to be an evolving consensus at least on the general principle. Regulators, including the Federal Reserve, strongly support the basic approach embodied in FDICIA; namely that regulators should place limits on depository institutions in such a way as to replicate, as closely as possible, the discipline that would be imposed by a marketplace consisting of informed participants and devoid of the moral hazard associated with the safety net.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, as always, the devil is in the details. The difficult question is how should a regulator use \"market-based\" or \"performance-based\" measures in determining which, if any, supervisory sanctions or limits to place on a bank. FDICIA's approach was straightforward. Supervisory sanctions under Prompt Corrective Action were to be based on the bank's risk performance as measured by its levels of regulatory capital, in particular its leverage ratio and total risk-based capital ratio under the Basle capital standards. These standards now seem well-intended but rather outdated. Certainly, the Basle capital standards did the job for which they were designed, namely stopping the secular decline in bank capital levels that, by the late 1980s, threatened general safety and soundness. But the scope and complexity of banking activities has proceeded apace during the last two decades or so, and standard capital measures, at least for our very largest and most complex organizations, are no longer adequate measures on which to base supervisory action for several reasons: The regulatory capital standards apportion capital only for credit risk and, most recently, for market risk of trading activities. Interest rate risk is dealt with subjectively, and other forms of risk, including operating risk, are not treated within the standards. Also, the capital standards are, despite the appellation \"risk-based,\" very much a \"one-size-fits-all\" rule. For example, all non-mortgage loans to corporations and households receive the same arbitrary 8 percent capital requirement. A secured loan to a triple-A rated company receives the same treatment as an unsecured loan to a junk-rated company. In other words, the capital standards don't measure credit risk although they represent a crude proxy for such risk within broad categories of banking assets. Finally, the capital standards give insufficient consideration to hedging or mitigating risk through the use of credit derivatives or effective portfolio diversification.\n",
            "\n",
            "These shortcomings of the regulatory capital standards were beginning to be understood even as they were being implemented, but no consistent, consensus technology existed at that time for invoking a more sophisticated standard than the Basle norms. To be sure, more sophisticated standards were being used by bank supervisors, during the examination process, to determine the adequacy of capital at any individual institution. These supervisory determinations of capital adequacy on a bank-by-bank basis, reflected in the CAMEL ratings given to banks and the BOPEC ratings given to bank holding companies, are much more inclusive than the Basle standards. Research shows that CAMEL ratings are much better predictors of bank insolvency than \"risk-based\" capital ratios. But, a bank-by-bank supervision, of course, is not the same thing as the writing of regulations that apply to all banks.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is now evident that the simple regulatory capital standards that apply to all banks can be quite misleading. Nominally high regulatory capital ratios--even risk-based capital ratios that are 50 or 100 percent higher than the minimums--are no longer indicators of bank soundness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Meanwhile, however, some of our largest and most sophisticated banks have been getting ahead of the regulators and doing the two things one must do in order to properly manage risk and determine capital adequacy. First, they are statistically quantifying risk by estimating the shape of loss probability distributions associated with their risk positions. These quantitative measures of risk are calculated by asset type, by product line, and, in some cases, even down to the individual customer level. Second, the more sophisticated banks are calculating economic capital, or \"risk capital,\" to be allocated to each asset, each line of business, and even to each customer, in order to determine risk-adjusted profitability of each type of bank activity. In making these risk capital allocations, banks are defining and meeting internal corporate standards for safety and soundness. For example, a banker might desire to achieve at least a single-A rating on his own corporate debt. He sees that, over history, single-A debt has a default probability of less than one-tenth of one percent over a one year time horizon. So the banker sets an internal corporate goal to allocate enough capital so that the probability of losses exceeding capital is less than 0.1 percent. In the language of statistics, this means that allocated capital must \"cover\" 99.9 percent of the estimated loss probability distribution.\n",
            "\n",
            "Once the banker estimates risk and allocates capital to that risk, the internal capital allocations can be used in a variety of ways -- for example, in so-called RAROC or risk-adjusted return on capital models that measure the relative profitability of bank activities. If a particular bank product generates a return to allocated capital that is too low, the bank can seek to cut expenses, reprice the product, or focus its efforts on other, more profitable ventures. These profitability analyses, moreover, are conducted on an \"apples-to-apples\" basis, since the profitability of each business line is adjusted to reflect the riskiness of the business line.\n",
            "\n",
            "What these bankers have actually done themselves, in calculating these internal capital requirements, is something regulators have never done--defined a bank soundness target. What regulator, for example, has said that he wants capital to be high enough to reduce to 0.1 percent the probability of insolvency? Regulators have said only that capital ratios should be no lower than some number (8 percent in the case of the Basle standards). But as we should all be aware, a high capital ratio, if it is accompanied by a highly risky portfolio composition, can result in a bank with a high probability of insolvency. The question should not be how high is the bank's capital ratio, but how low is its failure probability.\n",
            "\n",
            "In sharp contrast to our 8 percent one-size-fits-all capital standard, the internal risk-capital calculations of banks result in a very wide range of capital allocations, even within a particular category of credit instrument. For example, for an unsecured commercial credit line, typical internal capital allocations might range from less than 1 percent for a triple-A or double-A rated obligor, to well over 20 percent for an obligor in one of the lowest rating categories. The range of internal capital allocations widens even more when we look at capital calculations for complex risk positions such as various forms of credit derivatives. This great diversity in economic capital allocations as compared to regulatory capital allocations, creates at least two types of problem. When the regulatory capital requirement is higher than the economic capital allocation, the bank must either engage in costly regulatory arbitrage to evade the regulatory requirement or change its portfolio, possibly leading to suboptimal resource allocation. When the regulatory requirement is lower than the economic capital requirement, the bank may choose to hold capital above the regulatory requirement but below the economic requirement; in this case, the bank's nominally high capital ratio may mask the true nature of its risk position.\n",
            "\n",
            "Measuring bank soundness and overall bank performance is becoming more critical as the risk activities of banks become more complex. This condition is especially evident in the various nontraditional activities of banks. In fact, \"nontraditional\" is no longer a very good adjective to describe much of what goes on at our larger institutions. Take asset securitization, for example. No longer do our largest banks simply take in deposit funds and lend out the money to borrowers. Currently, well over $200 billion in assets that, in times past, have resided on the books of banks, now are owned by remote securitization conduits sponsored by banks. Sponsorship of securitization, which is now almost solely a large bank phenomenon, holds the potential for completely transforming the traditional paradigm of \"banking.\" Now, loans are made directly by the conduits, or are made by the banks and then immediately sold to the conduits. To finance the origination or purchase of the loans, a conduit issues several classes of asset-backed securities collateralized by the loans. Most of the conduit's debt is issued to investors who require that the senior securities be highly rated, generally double-A and triple-A. In order to achieve these ratings, the conduit obtains credit enhancements insulating the senior security holders from defaults on the underlying loans. Generally, it is the bank sponsor that provides these credit enhancements, which can be in the form of standby letters of credit to the conduit, or via the purchase of the most junior/subordinated securities issued by the conduit. In return for providing the credit protection, as well as the loan origination and servicing functions, the bank lays claim to all residual spreads between the yields on the loans and the interest and non-interest cost of the conduit's securities, net of any loan losses. In other words, securitization results in banks taking on almost identically the same risks as if the loans were kept on the books of the bank the old-fashioned way.\n",
            "\n",
            "But while the credit risk of a securitized loan pool may be the same as the credit risk of holding that loan pool on the books, our capital standards do not always recognize this fact. For example, by supplying a standby letter of credit covering so-called \"first-dollar\" losses for the conduit, a bank might be able to reduce its regulatory capital requirement, for some of its activities, by 90 percent or more compared with what would be required if the bank held the loans directly on its own books. The question, of course, is whether the bank's internal capital allocation systems recognize the similarity in risk between, on the one hand, owning the whole loans and, on the other hand, providing a credit enhancement to a securitization conduit.\n",
            "\n",
            "If the risk measurement and management systems of the bank are faulty, then holding a nominally high capital ratio--say, 10 percent--is little consolation. In fact, nominally high capital ratios can be deceiving to market participants. If, for example, the bank's balance sheet is less than transparent, potential investors or creditors, seeing the nominally high 10 percent capital, but not recognizing that the economic risk capital allocation should, in percentage terms, be much higher, could direct an inappropriately high level of scarce resources toward the bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "Credit derivatives are another example of the evolution. The bottom line is that, as we move into the 21st century, traditional notions of \"capital adequacy\" will become less useful in determining the safety and soundness of our largest, most sophisticated, banking organizations. This growing discrepancy is important because \"performance-based\" solutions likely will continue to be touted as the basis for expanded bank powers or reductions in burdensome regulation. For example, the Federal Reserve's recent proposed liberalization of procedures for Regulation Y activities applies to banking companies that are \"well-capitalized\" and \"well-managed.\" Similarly, the OCC's recent proposed liberalization of rules for bank operating subsidiaries applies to \"well-capitalized\" institutions. Also, industry participants continue to call for expanded powers and/or reduced regulatory burden based on \"market tests\" of good management and adequate capital.\n",
            "\n",
            "It will not be easy reaching consensus on how to measure bank soundness and overall bank performance. It cannot simply be done by observing market indicators. For example, we cannot easily use the public ratings of holding company debt. The ratings, after all, are achieved given the existence of the safety net. The ratings are biased, therefore, from the perspective of achieving our stated goal--to impose prudential limits on banks as if there were no net. In addition, I am sure that there would be disagreement between market participants and regulators over what should be acceptable debt ratings.\n",
            "\n",
            "The solution may be for the regulators to use the analytical tools developed by the market participants themselves for risk and performance assessment. Regulators already have begun to move in this direction. For example, beginning in January 1998, qualifying large multinational banks will be able to use their internal Value-at-Risk models to help set capital requirements for the market risk inherent in their trading activities. The Federal Reserve is also conducting a pilot test of the pre-commitment approach to capital for market risk. In this approach, banks can choose their own capital allocations, but would be sanctioned heavily if cumulative trading losses during a quarter were to exceed their chosen capital allocations. These new and innovative methods for treating the age-old problem of capital adequacy are likely to be followed by an unending, evolutionary flow of improvements in the prudential supervisory process. As the industry makes technological advances in risk measurement, these advances will become imbedded in the supervisory process. For example, the banking agencies have announced programs to place an increased emphasis on banks' internal risk measurement and management processes within the assessment of overall management quality--that is, how well a bank employs modern technology to manage risk will be reflected in the \"M\" portion of the bank's CAMEL rating. In a similar vein, now that VaR models are being used to assess regulatory capital for market risk, it is easy to envision that, down the road, banks' internal credit risk models and associated internal capital allocations will also be used to help set regulatory capital requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regulation and supervision, like industry practices themselves, are continually evolving processes. As supervisors, our goal must be to stay abreast of best practices, incorporate these practices into our own procedures where appropriate, and do so in a way that allows banks to remain sufficiently flexible and competitive. In conducting prudential regulation we should always remember that the optimal number of bank failures is not zero. Indeed, \"market-based\" performance means that some institutions, either through poor management choices, or just because of plain old bad luck, will fail. As regulators, we must carefully balance these market-like results with concerns over systemic risk. And, as regulators of banks, we must always remember that we do not operate in a vacuum--the activities of nonbank financial institutions are also important to the general well-being of our financial system and the macro economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regulators, of course, can only work with the framework laid down by Congress. Let me conclude with the hope that this Congress will build on the experience of the last few years, including the experience with FDICIA, and take the next steps toward creating a structural and regulatory framework appropriate to the 21st century.\n",

            "Financial Modernization: Rationalizing the Structure of the Financial Services Industry\n",
            "\n",
            "My topic this morning is financial modernization. Financial modernization today refers to legislative and regulatory reform to remove limitations on permissible activities for banking, securities, and other financial services firms. Financial modernization in the United States is sometimes used to refer specifically to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act which limits banks' involvement in security underwriting and dealing. I will use a broader interpretation that includes, in addition, the revision of the Bank Holding Company Act to allow banks to engage in insurance and other financial activities, the establishment of a two-way street that allows banks to affiliate with securities and insurance firms and insurance and security firms to affiliate with banks, a rationalization of the regulatory framework for banks and other financial services firms appropriate to the expanded powers and structural reforms, and at least a careful consideration of a common charter for commercial banks and thrift institutions and the mixing of banking and commerce.\n",
            "\n",
            "The financial services industry is moving in the direction of expanded activities and increased competition, with or without Congressional action, driven by market realities, financial innovations, technological change and global competition. Federal banking regulators are cooperating in this process, often reluctantly, but recognizing already existing erosions to regulations. Their ability to do so is often limited by statutory constraints, however, and, as a result, a clean and full rationalization of the structure of the financial services industry cannot be achieved without Congressional action. Nevertheless, what lies ahead is less a revolution than the completion of an ongoing process of financial market evolution.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are important disagreements about the breadth of expanded activities appropriate in banking organizations, the costs and benefits of structural restrictions to protect banks from added risks, and the appropriate regulatory framework for the reformed financial services industry. Nonetheless, I believe that policy makers have come to the conclusion that, while their hand may be forced by events, there are significant benefits from expanding the permissible activities of banks and other financial services firms. These benefits include increased competition in the financial services industry, and increased efficiency and consumer convenience in the provision of financial services.\n",
            "\n",
            "Allowing securities firms to compete directly with banks and banks with securities firms and each to compete with insurance firms will clearly enhance competition in the financial services industry. Economic theory and historical experience suggest that competition lowers costs, increases pressure for innovation, and increases attentiveness to the needs and convenience of customers. Financial modernization would allow financial services firms to serve better the needs and convenience of their customers both by lowering the costs of financial services and by facilitating one-stop shopping. The Edge Act already permits U.S. banks to compete on more equal terms outside the U.S. by permitting the Federal Reserve to authorize U.S. banks to do abroad certain activities, e.g., securities underwriting and dealing, not authorized directly to U.S. banks in the U.S. Moreover, U.S. banks are consistently evaluated by foreigners as the most innovative in the world. Nonetheless, easing of regulations would enhance marginally the international competitiveness of U.S. banks. Financial modernization also promotes efficiency in the production of financial services by allowing increased diversification of income sources by financial services firms and by allowing such firms to take advantage of economies of scope, that is, efficiencies that arise from producing related products.\n",
            "\n",
            "Think of financial modernization as a puzzle involving domestic and foreign financial service providers and consumers, the permissible activities, the organizational structures, the safeguards, the regulators, the legislators, and the Administration. The Administration and the legislators, with input from the regulators, have to decide which activities go to which providers in what organizational structures subject to what safeguards, under the oversight of which regulators, all for the maximum benefit of consumers. It may not be quite as simple as it sounds!\n",
            "\n",
            "The providers are the institutions whose future hangs in the balance: thrifts, banks, and nonbank financial services firms. Banks and thrifts may be combined and thrifts may therefore not survive as a separate entity. And, once the legislation is passed, affiliations may occur across commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance firms. In any case, only a subset of providers would be allowed to participate in this game. For example, only banking institutions that were found to be well capitalized and well managed and had adequate internal controls would be allowed to engage in the expanded activities. This is part of the trend to incentive-based regulation in which expanded activities and more streamlined regulation are confined to banking firms whose strength and performance suggest they can handle the increased risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "The permissible activities include those that banks are currently allowed to engage in directly; the somewhat broader and evolving set of financial activities that bank holding companies have been allowed to engage in through their subsidiaries; additional activities that fill out the spectrum of financial activities; and finally, possibly, commercial activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The choices for organizational structures include a universal banking model, where all activities are conducted inside the bank; the operating subsidiary model, favored by the Comptroller of the Currency, in which some activities are restricted to operating subsidiaries of banks; and the bank holding company model, the traditional preference of the Board of Governors, in which some activities are restricted to subsidiaries of the bank holding company.\n",
            "\n",
            "Safeguards refer to prudential limitations on activities between the bank and its subsidiaries (and affiliates) in order to protect the public from conflicts of interest and other abuses, but primarily to limit the risks to the bank from the activities in the subsidiaries as well as to limit the transfer of the subsidy inherent in the safety net to bank subsidiaries and affiliates. The most widely enforced prudential limitations are those associated with sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which limit financial transactions between a bank and its affiliates. Such transactions must be at arms-length and collateralized and, except for those collateralized by U.S. government securities, are subject to quantitative limits based on bank capital. In addition, banking regulators have sometimes imposed firewalls (including, for example, physical separation of banks and their affiliates and limitations on employee and director interlocks) to provide further protection and insulation of the bank from activities conducted by subsidiaries.\n",
            "\n",
            "The regulators include the three federal banking agencies (OCC for national banks, the FDIC for state nonmember banks, and the Federal Reserve for state member banks and all bank holding companies), the OTS (the regulator of thrifts, other than credit unions), and the regulators of nonbank financial services activities (e.g., the SEC for securities and state insurance authorities for insurance).\n",
            "\n",
            "The legislators include the members of the House and Senate, with special focus on the Senate and House Banking Committees where financial modernization legislation will be written. The Administration effort is led by Treasury.\n",
            "\n",
            "Before I identify the key issues that have to be settled before the puzzle can be addressed, it will be useful to set the stage by explaining why banks are regulated. This will help motivate why bank activities have traditionally been restricted and why restrictions and prudential limitations are generally imposed when expanded activities are allowed in banking organizations. This will also help to motivate my subsequent discussion of the Board's views on expanded power and structural restrictions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Two special characteristics of banking are critical to understanding why banks are regulated. First, banks have access to a government safety net through deposit insurance, the discount window, and payment system guarantees. Because deposit insurance can never be fully and accurately priced, it is necessary to monitor and sometimes to act to control bank risks in order to protect the potential call on taxpayers. The result is that banks are, in effect, subsidized by the government. This subsidy, in turn, creates incentives for banks to take more risk. That is, the safety net creates moral hazard incentives for risk-taking, because the safety net--and potentially taxpayers--may absorb most of the losses if the gamble fails. In effect, the incentive for the creditors of the bank to monitor banks' risk taking--the kind of monitoring that goes on for, say, finance companies--and the market pressures to have high capital to absorb losses are simply blunted for entities with access to the safety net. That monitoring and pressure for capital has been taken over by the grantor of the safety net: the government.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second characteristic of banking is that banks--especially large ones--are capable of being the conduits of systemic risk and crisis in financial markets. A breakdown of the payments system or other contagion effect that hampers the ability of banks to intermediate credit flows could have serious consequences for the economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The challenge is to maintain sufficient regulation to protect taxpayers, avoid unnecessary extensions of the safety net, and mitigate moral hazard incentives without undermining the competitiveness of the banking industry and its ability to take risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some have suggested that the government safety net, instead of being a subsidy to banks, has become a weight around their neck in the form of burdensome regulation that makes it difficult for banks to compete successfully against less regulated financial services firms. A solution might therefore be to limit or even eliminate the government safety net or at least charge deposit premiums that better price the risks involved. But the safety net has effectively eradicated the threat of runs on banks, has become capitalized in the value of bank equity, and in any case is so politically popular as to be unassailable. Our point of departure is therefore to assume that the government safety net will remain in place and will not be priced high enough to make it moot. Indeed, none of the legislative reform proposals in Congress would alter the access of banks to the government safety net.\n",
            "\n",
            "There will no doubt be continued efforts to reduce the net subsidy of the safety net. In addition to efforts to price insurance and access to central bank credit and the payments system more \"accurately,\" I anticipate that the government will continue other efforts. For example, I think the correct way to read prompt corrective action and high capital requirements is as an offset to safety net incentives that create moral hazards.\n",
            "\n",
            "More generally, we can discern five regulatory approaches that traditionally have been employed to limit the extension of the subsidy, control moral hazard incentives, and limit the risk to the taxpayer associated with access by banks to the government safety net. First, banks can be required to hold enough capital in relation to risks so that moral hazard incentives are minimized. Second, supervision and examination of banks by their regulators can insure that banking organizations maintain effective internal controls and implement an effective risk management process so that the safety and soundness of banks is protected and the risk to taxpayers minimized. Third, banks can be restricted to activities that do not present undue risks. Fourth, banking organizations can be required to conduct their riskier activities outside the bank itself, so that the bank is insulated from those greater risks. Fifth, prudential limitations can be enforced to reduce the prospect that transactions between the banks and their affiliates housing riskier activities could threaten the safety and soundness of banks. Financial modernization represents a reconsideration of these regulatory approaches in the context of reform intended to reduce the segmentation of the financial services industry and increase competition.\n",
            "\n",
            "The regulatory approach to maintaining the safety and soundness of banks has evolved over the period beginning from the banking and financial market reforms of the Great Depression era through today. From the 1930s through most of the 1970s, regulators focused on keeping the banking industry safe and sound by insulating banks from competition and limiting the activities in which they could compete. As a result, the financial services industry became highly segmented into separate entities providing commercial banking, investment banking, insurance services, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "By the late 1970s, the changed economic environment along with advances in technology, financial innovation, and globalization were presenting U.S. banks with increased competition from not only foreign banks, but from domestic thrifts, nondepository financial institutions, and the securities market as well. Banks responded by replacing lost business and lower margins with expanded off-balance sheet activities such as securitization, back-up lines of credit and guarantees, and derivatives. These responses helped banks to substitute fee and trading income for some of the interest income lost through competition with other financial intermediaries. Moreover, the larger banks generally sought expanded securities powers, so that they could stem the loss of customer business to capital markets. Regulators responded by reducing, in so far as they could under the law, the regulatory limits on banks and creating a more level playing field for banks and nonbanking firms. Financial modernization would further advance this process that has already blurred the distinction among financial services firms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Next the puzzle of powers, structures, and regulators must be solved. We need some guiding principles. The primary standard by which all modifications should be measured is the benefit to consumers of financial services. Would it make such services cheaper, more easily available, more convenient? Would it facilitate and foster innovation and competition? Modernization reforms that only increase provider profits--say, by eliminating outdated and costly regulation--are desirable, but only if, at a minimum, they do not reduce competition and consumer service.\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that primary principle, a second standard is to rely, in so far as compatible with the other goals, on the market. Thus, within such constraints, the scope of financial activities of banking organizations should be decided by the organizations themselves. When the special nature of banking makes reliance on the market impossible, the regulator should try to simulate market responses. Prompt corrective action is an example.\n",
            "\n",
            "Third, we should not lose sight of the special characteristics of banking that dictate regulation. These continue to suggest that there must be appropriate capital requirements, structure, supervision, and examination in banking organizations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Fourth, at the same time, the regulatory framework for financial services should be simplified and refined.\n",
            "\n",
            "In resolving the key regulatory issues, we should address three questions: First, what expanded activities should banks be allowed to conduct? Second, what organizational restrictions, if any, should be imposed on these new activities? The task here is to balance the benefits from achieving potential synergies among related activities and efficiencies from diversification and economies of scope, on the one hand, with the need to protect the safety net, that is, the taxpayer, on the other. Third, what regulatory framework most appropriately accommodates expanded activities, while also adequately protecting the safety and soundness of banks, controlling systemic risk, and promoting effective monetary policy?\n",
            "\n",
            "I will outline the key issues each question raises, beginning in each case with the Board's position.\n",
            "\n",
            "Activities The discussion of expanded activities centers really on securities and insurance. I will therefore begin by setting out the current limitations on such activities in banking organizations, explain the Board's position on expanded powers, and then turn to unsettled substantive issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 prohibits banks from underwriting or dealing in securities, with the exceptions of U.S. government and agency issues, and municipal general obligation bonds. Nonbank affiliates of Federal Reserve member banks are also prohibited from being \"principally engaged\" in underwriting or dealing in non-exempt securities. Since 1987, the Board has allowed member banks to conduct limited non-exempt securities activities through subsidiaries of a bank holding company, referred to as section 20 affiliates, because section 20 of Glass-Steagall prohibited affiliation on the \"principally engaged\" criterion. In the 1980s, the Board initially determined that an affiliate was not \"principally engaged\" in prohibited activities if no more than 5% of its revenues came from non-exempt sources. That limit was subsequently raised to 10%, and in December of 1996, the Board expanded the non-exempt revenue limit to 25%. Most major U.S. banks, I might add, have had experience in securities activities through their foreign affiliates. Most of these foreign activities, in turn, are conducted, subject to certain percentage and dollar limitations, through their Edge corporations, which are generally subsidiaries of the bank. By statute, Edge corporations are permitted to engage in activities abroad not permitted in the U.S. if necessary to compete on an equal basis with local rivals.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Board has concluded that eligible securities activities, section 20 experience with ineligible securities, and activities through Edge corporations, have provided banks with considerable experience with securities activities. In addition, banks have been permitted to conduct private placements, provide discount and full service brokerage services, offer financial advisory services, and broker proprietary mutual funds. The repeal of the statutory limitation on securities activities by a bank affiliate would only extend an already significant presence of banks in securities activities and build upon a base of existing experience. In addition, it would provide increased competition without--by the record--increasing bank risks significantly. Moreover, the Glass-Steagall restrictions on securities activities were motivated by concern that abuses of such powers had contributed to the banking crises of the great Depression era. Subsequent research, however, has found that these concerns were greatly exaggerated and that there was no evidence that abuses in securities activities played a significant role in the banking crisis. As a result, there is little controversy about the merits of repeal of Glass Steagall.\n",
            "\n",
            "Bank holding companies have been prohibited from insurance sales and underwriting since 1982, although existing activities were grandfathered. National banks located towns with a population of 5000 or less are allowed to serve as a general insurance agent. The Comptroller, supported by recent court decisions, has allowed such banks to engage in national sales from offices located in such towns. A number of states allow banks they charter to engage in insurance agency activities quite broadly. At the same time, the FDIC Improvement Act in 1991 prohibits state banks insured by the FDIC from engaging in underwriting insurance beyond the extent permitted for national banks. As a result, banks are gaining some experience in insurance agency activities, but have quite limited experience with insurance underwriting activities. Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus that selling all types of insurance and possibly underwriting life insurance would not present undue risks to banks and would benefit consumers.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is important to note that securities and insurance activities are the only financial activities prohibited to banking organizations by statute. With the exceptions perhaps of property and casualty insurance, both activities seem to reflect manageable risks for banks. Consequently both activities would seem compatible with present organizational structures and prudential limitations. Indeed, the diversification of income sources might suggest that the extension of activities to include securities and insurance activities could, on balance, reduce the overall riskiness of the consolidated enterprise. However, commercial activities raise greater concerns.\n",
            "\n",
            "Think of a continuum of powers, including those currently permissible for banks and those under consideration with a ranking from low to greater risk. Where do securities underwriting and dealing and insurance agency and underwriting fall on this spectrum? While the answer may not be clear, I think that it is fair to argue that brokering, underwriting, and dealing in life insurance or securities are generally less risky than most of the credit risks banks have taken with their traditional lending activities. As we have seen in recent years with commercial real estate, energy, agricultural, and developing country loans, lending is hardly risk-free. Securities and insurance brokerage, in contrast, contain little risk, per se, and with their reliance on actuarial tables, life insurance underwriting activities would seem to present risks that banks could easily manage and control. Underwriting of casualty and property insurance, might, however, be beyond the higher end of the current risk spectrum.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Board of Governors has supported both a repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act to permit banking organizations to underwrite and deal in securities and also a reform of the Bank Holding Company Act to permit banks broader powers regarding insurance brokerage and underwriting. The possible exception involves casualty and property underwriting, which the Board historically has felt raised concerns about risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Board has not, however, supported affiliations between banking and commercial firms. While it does not object in principle to such affiliations, it has taken the position that it is perhaps best for banking organizations and their regulators to gain experience with new financial activities before considering broader combinations. The benefits simply appear less certain and the risks greater. The Board would therefore prefer to proceed with the expansion in financial services and to defer any discussion of commercial activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Admittedly, such an approach could complicate the modernization process, since some unitary thrifts and insurance firms are already affiliated with commercial firms. Would they need to divest such activities, or could they be satisfactorily grandfathered if either the thrift and bank charters are combined or banks are permitted to affiliate with securities and insurance firms?\n",
            "\n",
            "Organizational Structure The Board's position has been that any meaningful expansion of new activities should take place in nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. In contrast, the Comptroller of the Currency has proposed allowing such activities in subsidiaries of national banks. Some have viewed this difference as simply a battle over turf. The Federal Reserve supervises bank holding companies and would therefore expand its regulatory reach if new powers were forced into the BHC model. The OCC supervises national banks and would potentially expand its influence relative to the Federal Reserve if nonbank activities were permitted in operating subsidiaries of banks. But much more is at stake here than turf.\n",
            "\n",
            "The location in the organizational structure of nonbanking activities raises fundamental questions about the safety net. Recall my earlier comments about the fundamental tension between risk-taking and market orientation, on the one hand, and the stabilization and moral hazard implications of the safety net, on the other. Such tensions focus, I submit, on the special benefits--the subsidy, if you will--that recipients of the safety net receive and the regulation that goes with it. We in the United States should be careful not to inadvertently extend the safety net--and, almost for certain, bank-like regulations--in the process of dealing with financial reform and organizational structure. This is a difficult issue, requiring balance and judgment, and I would hope that Congress would carefully review the options and their full implications.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regulatory Framework Currently, all bank holding companies are subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve; banks are regulated by state banking agencies, the OCC, the FDIC, and/or the Federal Reserve depending on their charter, and, for state banks, on their choice, and there is some functional regulation of specialized activities of holding company subsidiaries. Consolidated bank holding company supervision includes holding company capital requirements, examinations, and reporting requirements.\n",
            "\n",
            "Two substantive issues are important as we consider the regulatory framework most appropriate for accommodating financial modernization. First, to what degree is consolidated supervision and regulation appropriate? Second, what role should the Federal Reserve have in regulating banks and financial conglomerates that include banks?\n",
            "\n",
            "Both the operating subsidiary and bank holding company models facilitate functional regulation by putting specialized activities that might be subject to functional regulation into separate entities. For example, securities activities subject to SEC capital requirements and other regulations would be put into a separate subsidiary and similarly with insurance activities subject to regulation by state insurance departments. Under a pure functional regulation scheme, bank regulators would supervise only the bank, and there would be no consolidated supervision of the entire entity.\n",
            "\n",
            "This appears, on the surface, clean and efficient, reflecting the benefits of specialization and division of labor among regulators. But it is completely out of step with emerging risk management practices at financial services firms and with norms for global banks and financial services firms around the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "Banking organizations are increasingly managing risks without regard to legal entities. For them to do otherwise would ignore the powerful concepts of portfolio theory and the gains they can achieve both from diversification and from managing risks on a consolidated basis. If financial services firms engage in consolidated risk management, regulators must insist on some measure of consolidated regulation that permits effective oversight of the consolidated entity.\n",
            "\n",
            "The U.S. participates actively in world forums with regulators of banking and other financial services. There is a growing emphasis in these meetings on sharing information and clear recognition of the value of consolidated supervision.\n",
            "\n",
            "If there is consolidated regulation, it could be carried out by the Federal Reserve, in line with the system's current role as regulator of bank holding companies. For example under Congressman Leach's bill, the Federal Reserve would be the umbrella regulator for the financial services holding companies that replace bank holding companies. An alternative model, however, might be for the regulator of the lead bank to be the umbrella regulator of the consolidated entity. That approach has the advantage of limiting the number of separate regulators of a given entity. It has the disadvantage, though, that the regulation of financial services holding companies would be disbursed among several agencies and that each agency could adopt different policies. A third model would have a single bank regulator for financial services holding companies whose predominant activity is banking and the SEC where the predominant activity involves securities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second issue is what role the Federal Reserve should have in banking regulation. You may recall that the Administration proposed in 1993 a consolidation of banking regulation that would have taken all regulatory, supervisory, and examination responsibilities away from the Federal Reserve and consolidated the current responsibilities of the OCC, and the supervisory and regulatory responsibilities of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve into a new federal banking commission.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Federal Reserve opposed consolidated supervision and regulation and strongly asserted the importance of maintaining a hands-on supervisory role for the Federal Reserve. That role is especially critical for large, global banking organizations, but also for at least a cross section of smaller banks. The Federal Reserve believes that such an active supervisory role is essential for it to conduct monetary policy and prevent or manage financial crises most effectively. For example, the information examiners developed about the severity of the credit crunch in the early 1990s contributed to the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain an unusually stimulative monetary policy well into the current expansion. That policy, in turn, helped to support the economy while banking institutions were returning to health and reestablishing their ability to provide credit to support a healthy expansion. As the nation's central bank, the Federal Reserve also has critical responsibilities to prevent or resolve major problems in financial markets that cannot be adequately met without timely and in-depth knowledge of the operating practices, risk-management procedures, and financial exposures of the banking system.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, the case for expanded financial activities for banks and other financial services firms is compelling. But it is important that differences in opinion about structural and prudential safeguards and the resulting regulatory framework be resolved, so that these disagreements do not block financial modernization efforts.\n",

            "Recent Developments in Supervision and Regulation and How They Affect the Debate on Financial Modernization\n",
            "\n",
            "I am pleased to have the opportunity to address this group at a time when developments in global financial markets are presenting particular challenges for market participants and market regulators alike.\n",
            "\n",
            "I was asked to talk with you today about both developments in Federal Reserve supervision and regulation, as well as the approaches to financial modernization being debated in the Congress. I won't try to cover the full waterfront on these topics, but would like to share with you some of the Board's considerable rethinking about the way we supervise and regulate bank holding companies. I will also describe how I believe the recent Board initiatives coming out of this process may well alter the debate about the structure and supervision of financial services in the United States -- a topic I believe has received insufficient attention in the legislative debate so far.\n",
            "\n",
            "I will focus my discussion of recent Board actions on the supervisory process and on three regulatory changes made or proposed by the Board: changes to the application and nonbanking provisions of Regulation Y, changes and proposed changes to the Board-imposed \"firewalls\" between a bank and a securities affiliate, and changes to the Board's anti-tying rules. I stress these three not necessarily because they are the most important undertaken by the Board, but because I believe that they most directly affect the debate about how financial services should be supervised.\n",
            "\n",
            "Supervisory Changes The cornerstone of the bank supervisory process is the verification of prudent practices and financial condition through on-site examinations, coupled with off-site surveillance. Traditionally, on-site examinations of bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries have focused on verifying compliance and determining the financial condition of an institution at the time of the examination by reviewing their loans and by testing other transactions. This process is changing.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Federal Reserve's supervisory oversight at the bank holding company level is increasingly directed at evaluating risk management, internal controls, and decisionmaking processes that are shared between a bank and its parent, rather than focusing on transactions and positions at nonbank affiliates. This focus is necessary given the continuing trend toward integrated management of financial activities on a consolidated basis. Testing the adequacy of risk management and internal control helps us understand the financial condition of the consolidated organization and the potential impact of consolidated risk management policies and internal controls on the operations of the insured depository institution. To implement this approach, the Federal Reserve last year began assigning a formal rating to risk management in our holding company and bank examination reports.\n",
            "\n",
            "Changes have come not just in what we examine, but also in how we examine. We are making greater use of internal risk management reports, the results of internal risk models, and the work of internal and external auditors. For example, the Federal Reserve is now collecting internal loan classification reports prepared by most of our larger banks, as well as other information generated by their internal risk management systems. This approach has a further advantage in that it can generally be conducted off-site, at less burden to the firm.\n",
            "\n",
            "Our examinations are also becoming more efficient through pre-visitation planning that better identifies those areas of a company's activities that pose the greatest risk. We are also making greater use of computer technology in the examination process and using automated systems that permit examiners to analyze data on their personal computers. And, of course, whenever possible we rely upon examination and inspection reports prepared by regulators of the individual entities within the bank holding company.\n",
            "\n",
            "Like examinations, disclosure practices of the past also focused narrowly on the financial condition of an institution at a point in time, using conventional accounting and regulatory measures. Today, however, disclosures are expanding to reveal not only the current risks of the balance sheet, but also management's philosophy for managing and controlling risk. Disclosure is an important aid to us as supervisors and, we hope, to market analysts. Improved disclosure has already been put into practice for derivatives and market risks, and we will continue to urge better and more broadly based disclosure of all major activities and exposures.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Effect of Supervisory Changes on Legislation As the issue of consolidated or \"umbrella\" supervision is debated in the legislative process, I believe it is important to examine how these supervisory developments alter that debate. There are those who argue that umbrella supervision of a diverse financial services holding company would either be an impossible task or an intolerable burden. But the risk-analysis and surveillance techniques that we have decided are the most effective for bank holding companies should also be adaptable to more diverse financial organizations that include banking operations. Clearly, we must all give additional thought to how such an adaptation would work so that we minimize the intrusion into new activities. Perhaps there should be some kind of carve-out for firms whose banking operations are a small part of the organization or if the firm is otherwise regulated. Nevertheless, to be successful, a financial services company should reap synergy gains not only by marketing a variety of products to customers but also by pooling and jointly managing diverse financial risks. Thus, the movement toward use of one treasury, one risk management policy, and one set of exposure limits would continue. It is those policies and risks that an umbrella supervisor must understand in order to gauge the risks to the insured institution.\n",
            "\n",
            "In fact, as I am sure this group will recall in the wake of BCCI, the Congress also became convinced of the importance of consolidated supervision of any banking organization. Through the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement Act, the United States not only recognized the importance of consolidated supervision, but strongly encouraged it as an international principle of banking supervision by requiring that any foreign bank seeking to enter the United States be subject to consolidated home country supervision.\n",
            "\n",
            "Subsequent history has confirmed that judgment. As I've noted, virtually all of the large holding companies now operate as integrated units and are managed as such. Thus, the Federal Reserve remains convinced that one supervisor must have the task of evaluating the organization as a whole.\n",
            "\n",
            "This view is now commonly accepted around the world. The idea has for some time been endorsed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, and many countries are adopting similar approaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "Still, I can certainly understand why some advocates of a more diversified financial services holding company would wish to abandon consolidated supervision. Consolidated supervision raises hard questions -- the kind of questions that can bog down legislation and splinter coalitions -- and questions that engage us even now. What authority should a consolidated supervisor have over non-financial activities, if they are allowed? How should the consolidated supervisor work with the primary supervisor of a bank, or a broker-dealer, or an insurance company? How much burden must consolidated supervision entail?\n",
            "\n",
            "As we all pursue the answers to these questions, perhaps the Federal Reserve's risk-based approach to supervision can provide insights into how umbrella supervision of an expanded organization could work.\n",
            "\n",
            "Regulatory Changes Just as with supervision, the regulatory side of the Federal Reserve has undergone profound changes of late.\n",
            "\n",
            "Just a few weeks ago, the Board approved a comprehensive streamlining of Regulation Y that should substantially diminish the regulatory burden on bank holding companies and foreign banks wishing to expand or innovate in the United States.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, the Board concluded that review of an application should focus on how the proposed acquisition or activity would affect the organization. The application should not become a vehicle for comprehensively evaluating and addressing supervisory and compliance issues at the applicant organization. This principle is also the basis for recent Congressional action to eliminate the prior approval requirement for engaging in Board-approved nonbanking activities under section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act, provided the company meets specified standards for capital and management at the time of its last examination. As a result, the Board has significantly streamlined the process for well-capitalized, well-run companies to acquire a bank or nonbank and eliminated the prior approval process for such companies to engage de novo in Board-approved nonbanking activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, the Board concluded that bank holding companies should be permitted to conduct nonbanking activities to the fullest extent permissible under the Bank Holding Company Act, and that Regulation Y should be sufficiently flexible to allow for industry changes in permissible activities without requiring additional regulatory filings. Accordingly, the Board removed restrictions on investment advisory activities, derivatives trading activities, leasing, and other activities whenever those restrictions impeded efficiency or imposed costs without conferring corresponding benefits to safety and soundness. The Board also permitted a data processing or management consulting subsidiary to derive up to 30 percent of its revenue from nonfinancial data processing or nonfinancial management consulting. And the Board has indicated that it will be pro-active in approving new activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The next area where the Board has been particularly active concerns firewalls between a bank and an affiliated securities firm, better known as a section 20 affiliate. Experience with these section 20 affiliates, and other affiliates engaging in similar activities without such restrictions, led the Board to conduct a comprehensive review of the firewalls. Much of the potential for conflicts of interest between a bank and a securities firm is addressed by other laws such as the registration and disclosure requirements and the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws. Legislative and regulatory enactments, many adopted since the Board's initial 1987 section 20 order, also provide important insulation between a bank and a section 20 affiliate by imposing qualitative and quantitative limits on inter-affiliate transactions and requiring that a customer receive disclosures detailing the identity of its counterparty and the product being purchased.\n",
            "\n",
            "Accordingly, the Board has repealed its restriction on cross-marketing between a bank and a section 20 affiliate, eliminated a blanket restriction on employee interlocks, and scaled back a blanket restriction on officer interlocks to include only a chief executive officer. The Board has also proposed to eliminate a firewall prohibiting a bank from providing any funding to a section 20 affiliate and three restrictions on a bank's extending credit or offering credit enhancements in support of securities being underwritten by its section 20 affiliate.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Board's proposal recognized that as financial intermediation has evolved, corporate customers frequently seek to obtain a variety of funding mechanisms from one source. By prohibiting banks from providing routine credit enhancements in tandem with a section 20 affiliate, the existing firewalls hamper the ability of bank holding companies to operate as one-stop financial services providers, thereby reducing options for customers. Instead, the Board has proposed to require that internal controls and operating standards ensure that a bank use independent credit judgment whenever it is acting in tandem with its section 20 affiliate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, the Board has taken action to allow greater packaging of products by bank holding companies. Since the 1970s, banks and bank holding companies have been prohibited from packaging their products unless the arrangement involved a traditional bank product. While this exception softened the impact of the statute, bank holding companies were nonetheless at a considerable disadvantage to their competitors, particularly as bundling of services has become a marketing imperative on both the retail and wholesale side of the business.\n",
            "\n",
            "After reviewing its experience with the statute, the Board recently repealed a regulation that had extended to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries the statutory prohibition on tying arrangements by banks. Experience taught us that these non-banks did not have the type of market power that Congress presumed banks possessed when it enacted an anti-tying statute. The Board has also created exceptions to the statute to allow package arrangements between bank holding company affiliates to the same extent as the statute allows them within the bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, and perhaps of greatest interest to you, the Board created a safe harbor to clarify that any transaction with a foreign customer was not covered by the statute. Thus, for example, a U.S. branch of a foreign bank can participate in a syndicated loan to a European firm, even if the loan is offered only as part of a package of services that would otherwise run afoul of the anti-tying law.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Effect of the Regulatory Climate on Legislation I think it worth noting how all these reforms may affect the debate about the corporate structure of bank holding companies -- specifically whether bank holding companies should be granted the option of moving activities prohibited to the bank into a subsidiary of the bank, and thereby funding those activities with subsidized funds.\n",
            "\n",
            "Descriptions of how the subsidy works and examples of the funding advantages it confers are plentiful. But I believe that it is so ingrained in our thinking that we sometimes take it for granted. Think how obvious the subsidy would be if it involved another industry -- for example, if the government guaranteed that commercial paper holders of the automobile industry would be repaid in full. To complete the other strands of the safety net -- the discount window and the payment system -- let us assume that automobile companies experiencing liquidity problems could borrow from the Federal Reserve for the purpose of repaying commercial paper, and that they are able to achieve risk-free settlement. The effects of extending such a subsidy are not difficult to imagine. Automakers would find it very easy to place their commercial paper, and would be able to pay a below-market yield. And, to the extent the hypothetical allowed, I would not be surprised to see automakers use this funding advantage to enter other businesses.\n",
            "\n",
            "So it is with banks -- and with subsidiaries of banks. Regulators can limit a bank's ability to subsidize its subsidiary through loans by capping their amount or regulating the rates the subsidiary must pay. But although one can limit the aggregate investment a bank can make in its subsidiary by requiring that such injections be deducted from the capital of the bank, the equity investment in the subsidiary is still funded from subsidized resources, and that subsidy transfer cannot be eliminated.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, both analytically and practically, I think it difficult to deny that banks and their subsidiaries benefit from a federal subsidy, and benefit in ways that an affiliate of the bank does not. Nevertheless, some argue that a parent-subsidiary structure is more efficient than a sibling structure, and must be allowed for a broader range of activities. But in light of the recent regulatory changes that I have described, I believe that this argument is now questionable. A bank and an affiliate can now avoid a redundant work force and duplication of effort by having employees serve in a dual capacity, or by allowing reporting lines to cross. For example, a common back office or treasury can be maintained. Furthermore, the two companies can market their products jointly to both retail and corporate customers. With these regulatory changes, banks and bank holding companies have opportunities to make considerable adjustments to their organizational structures and operating procedures as well as to offer new products to customers in new ways.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion Let me conclude by pointing out that the legislative debate has only just begun. Opinions are still developing, new ideas are still being presented, and positions are not yet cast in concrete. But even as new legislation is being debated, those of us who must try to interpret and administer existing laws recognize that we must do so in a developing global marketplace. I believe that the steps the Board has taken to make its regulatory and supervisory systems less burdensome and more risk focused will stand us in good stead in this changing financial environment. Nevertheless, comprehensive financial reform legislation is still needed to allow banking and other financial institutions to compete internationally and to offer the full range of financial services needed and demanded by their customers. Thank you.\n",

            "Financial Reform and the Importance of a Decentralized Banking Structure\n",
            "\n",
            "As always, it is a pleasure to address this convention of the Independent Bankers Association of America. This is the sixth year I have addressed this convention, and during that time four separate Congresses have debated how best to reform the financial system. I last spoke to you about financial reform in 1994, in Orlando, and it is clear that the real world occurrences of the past three years have not diminished the relevance of those words. Therefore, I shall reemphasize some of those thoughts today in the context of legislative proposals that are now before the current Congress.\n",
            "\n",
            "Let me begin by reiterating the essential thrust of the Federal Reserves position regarding financial reform. We believe that any changes, either in regulation or legislation, should be consistent with four basic objectives: (1) continuing the safety and soundness of the banking system; (2) limiting systemic risk; (3) contributing to macroeconomic stability; and (4) limiting the spread of both the moral hazard and the subsidy implicit in the safety net. My remarks today will focus primarily on the macroeconomic and risk implications of financial reform and how, in particular, such reform must enable community banks to maintain their critical role in the macroeconomy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The importance of the community bank Our banking system is the most innovative, responsive, and flexible in the world. At its core is a banking structure that is characterized by very large numbers of relatively small banks--more than 7000 separate banking organizations. This banking structure is very different from that of other industrialized nations--for example, there are less than 500 banks incorporated in England, Germany, and Canada combined. To be sure, the very largest U.S. banking organizations account for the lions share of banking assets. Still, no one institution controls more than 6 percent of total domestic banking assets in the United States.\n",
            "\n",
            "This highly decentralized, highly diverse banking structure is almost certainly the direct result of our market economy itself. Indeed, it is revealing that the first edition of Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations was published in 1776, the year of the birth of our nation. Our market-driven economy, founded on Smiths principle of \"natural liberty\" in economic choice, and the banking structure that evolved within that economy, have proved to be remarkably resilient. During the banking crisis of the late 1980s--a crisis which was felt in banking systems throughout the world--more than one thousand U.S. banks failed. But less than a decade later, loan loss reserves and bank capital at U.S. institutions stand at their highest levels in almost a half century. Moreover, the reestablishment of equilibrium regarding safety and soundness in our banking system was accomplished without costing the taxpayers a penny.\n",
            "\n",
            "To be sure, the effects of the banking crisis, as well as the ongoing pace of consolidation within the industry, have reduced the total number of banking organizations by more than a third since 1980. Nevertheless, we remain a nation characterized by a large number of smaller community banks--just as we are a nation characterized by a diversity and small average size of our nonfinancial businesses. Moreover, one cannot easily imagine nor desire that the decentralized, diverse nature of our banking system will fundamentally change any time soon. There is, of course, a strong connection between our banking structure and the nature of our small-business-oriented economy. Smaller banks traditionally have been the source of capital for small businesses that do not generally have access to securities markets. In turn, small, new businesses, often employing new technology, account for much of the growth in employment in our economy. The new firms come into existence often to replace old firms that were not willing or able to take on the risks associated with high-growth strategies. This replacement of stagnating firms with dynamic new firms--what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called the \"perennial gale of creative destruction\"--is at the heart of our robust, growth-oriented economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is this freedom to take on risk that characterizes our economy and, by extension, our banking system. Legislation and regulation of banks, in turn, generally should not aim to curtail the predilection of businesses and their banks to take on risk--so long as the general safety and soundness of our banking system is maintained. As I have said many times, regulators and legislators should not act as if the optimal degree of bank failure were zero. Rather, policymakers must continually assess the tradeoff between, on the one hand, protecting the financial system and the taxpayers, and on the other hand, allowing banks to perform their essential risk-taking activities, including the extension of risky credit. Optimal risk-taking on the part of our banks means that some mistakes will be made and some institutions will fail. Indeed, even if a bank is well-managed, optimal risk-taking means that such a bank can simply get unlucky. Either through mistakes of management or through the vagaries of economic luck, bank failure will occur, and such failure should be viewed as part of a natural process within our competitive system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Just as regulators and legislators must accept failure, they also must not, in their zealousness to maintain a safe and sound financial system, artificially restrict competition among banks or between banks and their nonbank counterparts. For example, we should not repeat the experiment with micromanagement of bank activities that was embodied in the 1991 FDICIA legislation, much of which was repealed in the 1994 banking legislation. In this regard, so long as we do not place artificial regulatory roadblocks in their way, I am not overly concerned with the ability of our smaller banks to compete with their large, regional or national counterparts. Our research shows that, when a large bank enters a new market through acquisition of an existing smaller institution, typically lending to small businesses initially declines. But then existing community banks take up the slack by lending to the borrowers spurned by the larger organization. Indeed, several community bankers have commented that they welcome the entry of large institutions into their markets via the acquisition route, seeing it as an opportunity to acquire some of the customer base that often is lost by the newly acquired bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "The dual banking system and the importance of choice of federal regulators Just as our decentralized banking structure is a key to the robustness of our macroeconomy, a key to the effectiveness of our banking structure is what we term the dual banking system. Our system of both federal and state regulation of banks has fostered a steady stream of innovations that likely would not have proceeded as rapidly or as effectively if our regulatory structure were characterized by a monolithic federal regulator. For example, the NOW account was invented by a state-chartered bank. Also, the liberalization of prohibitions against interstate banking has its origin in the so-called regional compacts that permitted interstate affiliations for banking companies in consenting states. Adjustable rate mortgages are yet another example of innovation at the state level that has benefitted financial institutions and their customers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Just as important as the fostering of innovation is the protection the dual banking system affords against overly rigid federal regulation and supervision. The key to protecting against overzealousness in regulation is for banks to have a choice of more than one federal regulator. With two or more federal regulators, a bank can choose to change its charter thereby choosing to be supervised by another federal regulator. That possibility has served as a constraint on arbitrary and capricious policies at the federal level. True, it is possible that two or more federal agencies can engage in a competition in laxity--but I worry considerably more about the possibility that a single federal regulator would become inevitably rigid and insensitive to the needs of the marketplace. So long as the existence of a federal guarantee of deposits and other elements of the safety net call for federal regulation of banks, such regulation should entail a choice of federal regulator in order to ensure the critical competitiveness of our banks.\n",
            "\n",
            "The job of a banking regulator, difficult under any circumstances and for a variety of reasons, is especially critical as it regards the connection running between banking risk and the impact of such risk-taking on the macroeconomy. As I have been pointing out, the historic purpose of banks is to take risk through the extension of credit to businesses and households--credit that is so vital to the growth and stability of the economy. But this fact creates a significant conflict for banking regulators. On the one hand, regulators are concerned with the cost of bank failure to the taxpayer and the impact of such failures on the general safety and soundness of the financial system. On the other hand, banks must take risks in order to finance economic expansion. Decisions about tradeoffs must be made. In the early 1990s, we saw how, in response to FDICIA, new regulations, weakened capital, and large loan losses, banks reduced their willingness to take risks, thereby contributing to a credit crunch and slower economic growth. This recent episode demonstrates clearly how tricky are these tradeoffs between necessary risk taking and protecting the banking system; a swing too far in either direction can create both short-term and long-term difficulties.\n",
            "\n",
            "A regulator without responsibility for macroeconomic growth and stability tends to have a bias against risk-taking. Such a regulator receives no praise if the economy is functioning well, but is criticized if there are too many bank failures. For such a regulator, the tradeoffs are one-sided and, if the decisions of such a regulator were left unchecked, the result might be a stagnant economy at whose core was a stagnant banking system. In contrast, the Federal Reserves economic responsibilities are an important reason why we have striven to maintain a consistent bank regulatory policy, one that entails neither excessive tightness nor ease in supervisory posture. The former would lead to credit crunches, the latter, with a lag, would lead to excessive bank failures.\n",
            "\n",
            "Just as the probability of bank failure should not be the only concern of the effective regulator, bank regulation is not the only, or even the most important, factor that affects the banking business. The condition of the macroeconomy also has something to say about your success as a banker. In that regard, the generally favorable macroeconomic conditions we have been facing for the past few years suggest that bankers should now take pause and reassess the appropriateness of their lending decisions. Mistakes in lending, after all, are not generally made during recessions but when the economic outlook appears benevolent. Recent evidence of thin margins and increased nonbank competition in portions of the syndicated loan market, as well as other indicators, suggest some modest underwriting laxity has a tendency to emerge during good times. This suggests the need for a mild caution that bankers maintain sound underwriting standards and pricing practices in their lending activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Toward financial reform without losing the strengths of our current system Let me now turn from general concerns over our regulatory structure to more specific concerns regarding the supervisory and regulatory treatment of our largest, most complex banking organizations--a subject in which I suspect community banks have some considerable interest. As the 105th Congress contemplates financial reform legislation, it is critical to focus on the issue of how best to supervise risk-taking in these large entities and, in particular, whether there should be significant umbrella supervision for the entire banking organization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Historically, bank holding companies have been largely confined to financial activities that are similar to, often the same as, those permissible to commercial banks. Also historically, supervision of banking organizations, both large and small, has tended to focus mainly on the need to protect the bank. To some extent, this emphasis on the bank rather than the nonbank activities of the banking organization was prompted by, or permitted by, management techniques that tended not to treat risk-taking in integrated fashion across the entire holding company. The regulators main concern was the bank, and bank safety could be analyzed more or less remotely and distinctly from the nonbank activities of the banking organization.\n",
            "\n",
            "More recently, the focus of supervision of holding companies by the Federal Reserve is being modified to parallel the changes in the management of banking companies. Most large institutions in recent years have moved toward consolidated risk management across all their bank and nonbank activities. Should the Congress permit new nonbanking activities by banking organizations it is likely that these activities too would be managed on a consolidated basis from the point of view of risk-taking, pricing, and profitability analysis. Our regulatory posture must adjust accordingly, to focus on the decision-making process for the total organization. Especially as supervisors focus more on the measurement and management of market, credit, and operating risks, supervisory review of firm-wide processes increasingly will become the appropriate principle underlying our assessment of an organizations safety and soundness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some market participants--especially nonbanks contemplating buying banks in the wake of any new Congressional legislation, as well as banks contemplating entering newly permissible nonbank activities--are naturally concerned over the thought of bank-like regulation being extended to their nonbank activities. We share this concern, and last month we asked Congress to modify our mandate to permit the Fed to be more flexible on such issues as applications for new activities. At the same time, however, we believe there has been some considerable misunderstanding of our basic philosophy of holding company supervision. The focus of the Feds inspections of nonbank activities of bank holding companies is to gain a sense of the overall strength of the individual units and their interrelations with each other and the bank. As I indicated above, emphasis is placed on the adequacy of risk management and internal control systems. Only if there is a major deficiency in these areas would we intend for a bank holding company inspection to become in any significant way intrusive, and the number of such intrusive inspections of nonbanking activities should be quite small if managements are following prudent business practices.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some observers have questioned not only the need for umbrella supervision, but also the need for the Feds involvement in such supervision. In addition to the reasons I cited above for central bank involvement in supervision, there is the issue of systemic risk and the fact that it is primarily the Federal Reserves obligation to maintain stability in our financial system and that systems interface with international financial markets. This obligation cannot be met solely via open market operations and use of the discount window, as powerful as these tools may be. Financial crises, when they occur, are unpredictable and diverse in nature. Globalization means that a domestic crisis can become international or that a foreign crisis can become a domestic concern. The Federal Reserves ability to respond quickly and effectively to any particular systemic threat rests primarily on our experience and expertise with the details of the U.S. and foreign banking and financial systems, including our familiarity with the payments and settlement system. This expertise, in turn, has been accumulated over the years primarily through our supervision of large domestic and multinational banking companies, and via our participation in large payments and settlement systems which are such a critical part of our financial infrastructure.\n",
            "\n",
            "In order to carry out our responsibility, the Fed must be directly involved in the supervision of banks of all sizes--such as now provided by member banks--and must also be able to address the problems of large banking companies if one or more of their activities endanger the stability of our financial system. This implies that the Federal Reserve have appropriate supervisory authority. Moreover, the new regulatory structure must retain our flexibility to respond to changes in the structure of the financial system, especially where such changes cannot easily be forecast in the wake of significant legislative changes. Systemic crises occur very rarely by their very definition. But when such crises do occur the consequences of slow or misdirected action are grave. The central bank, as the lender of last resort, must have the knowledge, the tools, and the authority necessary to act in a timely and decisive fashion. This is necessary to protect the whole financial system, not the least of which are the critical players among our community banks.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusions Let me conclude by reiterating two of the Federal Reserves most basic concerns as the current Congress deliberates the issue of financial reform. First, we should recognize the increasingly evident fact that financial firms of all sorts now engage routinely in a wide variety of financial activities that, just a few decades ago, were considered to be nontraditional. Even in cases where the financial activity is currently not permitted directly, the risks and returns of the activity can be mimicked through the prudent use of financial derivative instruments such as put and call options. We should recognize these facts and, in response, structure legislation that would permit the full economic integration of these various forms of financial activity, in order to gain the maximum operating efficiencies, the best tradeoffs between risk and return, and the most flexibility in meeting the needs of the customer. But new legislation should not attempt to accomplish too much too soon. The Board believes it is prudent to delay, or to implement in stages, broad authorization of nonfinancial activities for banking companies. We want to be sure of the smooth functioning of integrated financial activity before we address potential combinations of banking and commerce.\n",
            "\n",
            "Second, in permitting broadened financial powers, legislation should strive to maintain the current roles of both the dual banking system and the central bank. Financial reform should not be interpreted to mean regulatory reform for its own sake. Banks of all sizes must have their regulatory choices preserved, just as financial firms of all sizes should be permitted to engage prudently in a wide range of financial activity. Finally, the central bank must continue to be able to monitor and address activities of large banking organizations that might threaten the stability of the system. I am confident that prudent, reasoned financial reform can be accomplished in a manner that preserves the best of the current system while introducing the improvements that we all desire. Thank you very much.\n",

            "I am delighted to be here today with such a large group of my fellow economists. Economists are a very diverse group, but they share a basic kit of analytical tools that shape the way they approach problems. Economists share a useful shorthand vocabulary -- sometimes disparaged by others as jargon -- that makes it easier to communicate with each other. They share a sense of what kinds of things are known about how economies work and, far more important, an appreciation for how much is not known about the workings of any complex human system, including the economy in which we are all living and working right now. Most importantly, economists share a sense of excitement that others often find hard to fathom, about unraveling the many puzzles that abound in economic analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the moment, as a relatively new governor of the Federal Reserve, I am particularly glad to be in a group of economists, because I can be quite sure they don't share the popular stereotype of a Fed governor. This stereotype has several elements: Any Fed governor or central banker is an inflation freak who thinks reducing inflation should be the only objective of monetary policy and a zero inflation economy would be heaven. Any central banker has a firm view of exactly what growth rate the economy ought not to exceed and how high the unemployment rate ought to be to avoid inflation -- that something called the NAIRU is engraved on a stone tablet somewhere high on a mountain top and all we have to do is find it. Moreover, this stereotypical central banker knows exactly what monetary policy ought to be in order to keep the economy on the desired track.\n",
            "\n",
            "This stereotype leads otherwise quite intelligent members of the press to believe that if central bankers don't reveal this secret blueprint, it's because they are being deliberately obscure and inscrutable. The media's sacred calling is to interpret what central bankers really meant but out of sheer perversity did not choose to say.\n",
            "\n",
            "So it's a pleasure to be in a room full of economists who know that: while the Fed has access to all the latest statistics and an excellent staff to analyze them, it has not found the stone tablet; those of us at the Fed are working our way through the same fascinating puzzles that confront all economists and make the profession such a lively place to be.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would like to discuss today the primary puzzles that confront those of us in the monetary policymaking arena and then offer a few thoughts about how economists might focus their energies to be helpful in the current and upcoming macroeconomic policy process.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm afraid I don't fit the Fed Governor stereotype well at all. I'm not an inflation freak; I'm a growth freak. My answer to the question, \"How fast should the economy grow?\" is \"As fast as it sustainably can.\" We don't benefit from rapid growth spurts that unleash inflation which later has to be reigned in at a high price, just as we don't benefit from growth that damages the environment and creates a need for costly repair. But we ought to try to be on the highest growth track that is sustainable and stay on it with as few ups and downs as possible, because the downs are so costly, especially in terms of lost opportunity to build human capital. Only trouble is we don't know exactly what that track is and we're sure it's not immutable.\n",
            "\n",
            "By the same token, we ought to aim to keep unemployment as low as is sustainable. The benefits of tight labor markets are enormous, especially in a society whose future depends on continuous and persistent upgrading of the skills of the whole labor force. If we can keep labor markets at least as tight as they are now for a few years (which, judging from past history, would take an extraordinary combination of skillful policy and good luck), we can do a lot for the future standard of living of Americans.\n",
            "\n",
            "The benefit would accrue not just to those who are employed and are acquiring job skills and experience that they would not have gotten if they were unemployed. The benefit of tight labor markets is also in the signals they send to individuals and businesses that people should be employed as productively as possible, and that investment in training pays off. These are the economic conditions we need in general, but especially if we are to make welfare reform a success and establish new patterns of school and work for many young people who now see little hope for the future. Welfare reform is going to be difficult to accomplish. The best hope for success is avoiding recession for a long time.\n",
            "\n",
            "The benefits of the recent rapid job growth in the U.S. are especially evident by contrast with Europe. French and German unemployment rates have been incredibly high for a long time. French and German officials speak of their unemployment as \"structural\" and discuss the need to increase job training, improve the functioning of labor markets, and reduce the incentives not to work which are built into their generous benefit systems. These are all doubtless constructive things to do, but are unlikely to be very successful unless the economies are growing and jobs are being created. It is a lot easier to reduce structural unemployment when the demand for labor is brisk than when it is lagging.\n",
            "\n",
            "So this central banker believes that the goal of monetary policy, like the goal of fiscal policy, ought to be the highest sustainable growth rate and the lowest sustainable unemployment. Low inflation should not be thought of as an end in itself, but as a means to an end. Accelerating inflation has proved a threat to the sustainability of growth, and the self-perpetuating nature of inflation makes it more costly to correct than to avoid.\n",
            "\n",
            "The drafters of the Humphrey Hawkins Act gave the Fed multiple goals. They said: \"The Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.\" That's a bit ambiguous, but it's about as good a set of instructions as any. It would be a mistake to reword the Act, as some have suggested, to give the Fed a single objective -- reducing inflation -- on which to focus monetary policy. It would be especially unfortunate to specify a zero inflation target. First, because we don't measure inflation well enough to know when we have hit an exact target. Second, because the benefits of getting all the way to zero may not be great and the costs could be substantial, especially if there is significant reluctance to reduce nominal wages.\n",
            "\n",
            "But it is the second part of the central banker stereotype that economists see as most obviously absurd; namely, that the Fed actually controls interest rates and that it knows for sure where the monetary dials ought to be set to achieve a specific growth or unemployment target.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reality is that the Fed controls -- and rather imperfectly at that -- one extremely short-term interest rate, the fed funds rate. The fed funds rate certainly has some influence on banks' ability to extend credit, but its relation to the longer term rates that really matter to investors and home buyers is uncertain at best. The most that one can say about the Fed's principal monetary policy tool is that we can safely guess the direction of the effect of moving it and that we know there is a considerable lag between the move and the effect; but we cannot specify with any degree of certainty how large the effect is or how long it takes. That's a pretty blunt instrument.\n",
            "\n",
            "Any monetary policy move is a judgment call to be made with a great deal of humility because the judgment involves making a guess about what is likely to be happening to economic activity six months to a year or more in advance and whether resources might be underutilized by then or inflationary pressure might be building.\n",
            "\n",
            "The judgment call seems especially hard at the moment, although I suspect it almost always seems especially hard, because the economy is behaving in ways that are gratifyingly puzzling. The combination of macro-economic statistics is actually more favorable -- more growth, more employment, less budget deficit, less inflation -- than most people would have guessed possible a year or two ago. On one level, these are pleasant surprises; on another level, the behavior of the economy is revealing big challenges for the economics profession. These challenges are not likely to yield to more assiduous statistical manipulation of the same data that we already collect, but instead would require some new tools and new kinds of data.\n",
            "\n",
            "It would be a lot easier to make those judgment calls -- to move the blunt instrument so as to increase the probability of keeping labor markets tight and the economy growing at the highest sustainable rate -- if we knew a lot more about three interrelated questions. What's really going on in labor markets? What's really going on with prices? And especially, what's really going on with productivity?\n",
            "\n",
            "The labor market puzzle is partly why low unemployment is not leading to more obvious bottlenecks, more serious skill shortages and more rapid increases in compensation than we are in fact experiencing? It's tempting to believe that the uniformity of unemployment rates around the country indicates that the information age is paying off in better functioning labor markets. Possibly, at the equilibrating margin, people now move more easily to jobs, and jobs more easily to people than they once did. Possibly the organizations that worked so hard under the pressure of competition and recession to become less rigid and more flexible have in fact done so. But those are all guesses -- or wishful thinking. We don't know for sure.\n",
            "\n",
            "The price puzzle is why prices have been so well behaved in the face of labor costs that have been rising, albeit not especially fast. Has the economy, as so many business anecdotes allege, really become more fiercely competitive both nationally and internationally? Is the ability of firms to absorb labor cost increases without raising prices and without apparent reduction in profit margins confirming the hypothesis that productivity is rising faster than we thought, or faster than the admittedly inadequate data have been telling us?\n",
            "\n",
            "Indeed, it is the productivity puzzle that may hold the key to the gratifyingly mysterious behavior of the economy. Economists have thought for some time that the increasing importance of services in the economy is confounding the ability to understand what is happening to both product and productivity. We observed an increase in manufacturing productivity, but not in service productivity. Indeed, measured productivity was generally negative in service industries even where anecdotal evidence indicated that processes had been streamlined, products had been substantially improved, as well as greatly proliferated, and the people in the industry believed they were doing a much more effective job serving their customers. Economists freely admitted they didn't quite know how to identify and measure the quality of the products that were being produced in service industries, sometimes even in manufacturing. Economists also wondered aloud why all the investment in computers and information technology that was so obviously changing the world was not having an impact on productivity. We opined that maybe people weren't using computers very well or that many things people were using computers for -- like editing everything to death or spelling things correctly -- were not actually contributing to productivity at least as we were measuring it. Now, we should turn all this speculation into a full court press to figure out what kind of data we need and what kind of analytical methods we need to invent in order to understand better what is going on in this economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The need to improve the accuracy of the CPI has captured the attention of the press and the politicians because the indexing of benefits and tax brackets plays such a large part in the federal budget. But the problems of identifying what consumers are buying and how the quality of the items purchased has changed is very closely related to the problem of identifying what is being produced and what inputs are going into the production. The Clinton Administration, to its credit, has recognized the need for improving both the concepts and measurement of prices and products and has asked for a modest increase in resources for the statistical agencies in the President's budget, even in the context of general budget cuts. Strong support from the users of the data is surely in order -- not just from academic economists, but from the whole community of market analysts, Fed watchers and business and financial organizations who need to understand how the economy is working in order to operate better in it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Indeed, I have been struck since I have been at the Fed by the magnitude of the resources our economy puts into analyzing, reporting and commenting upon the standard set of statistics generated by federal statistical agencies every week -- efforts by the press, the business community and the people in between, such as those who write the newsletters and poop sheets that circulate over faxes and computers. Wouldn't it be in everyone's interest to take a portion of those resources and devote them to improving the flow of statistics that are being analyzed to death?\n",
            "\n",
            "Another thought that has struck me at the Fed is the enormous usefulness of reporting on examples of real world happenings -- anecdotes if you will -- and the absence of useful data that bridge the gap between the anecdote or real world case and an aggregate statistical series.\n",
            "\n",
            "One of the unique features of the Federal Reserve is its strong regional structure. The twelve Reserve Banks are very closely tied to the economies of their regions. The Reserve Banks not only supervise and interact with the local commercial banks, but also keep in close touch with the business, farming, labor, and community leadership in their area. They have broadly representative boards and a whole network of advisory committees (as does the Board of Governors itself).\n",
            "\n",
            "This network of contacts and information makes the Reserve Bank presidents very valuable participants in the FOMC discussion. Indeed, the most interesting part of an FOMC meeting is usually the regional round-up from the Bank presidents. This regional network and set of real world interactions has given me more sense of being in touch with the whole economy than I have had in previous economic policy jobs where I was largely dependent on aggregate statistics.\n",
            "\n",
            "I am not proposing government by anecdote and I am aware of the potential dangers of non-random samples. Nevertheless, I have the sense that our understanding of the economy would be greatly advanced if economists could set themselves seriously to the task of systematizing feedback about real world dilemmas being faced and decisions being made in the economy in ways that give a more nuanced and lively picture of what is going on out there than can be gleaned from standard statistical series.\n",

            "Issues in Financial Modernization\n",
            "\n",
            "Thank you. It is my pleasure to take part in what has become an important annual meeting on financial policy issues. It is my job to get you warmed up for a reception and dinner. Our hosts have a curious view that a discussion of financial modernization will whet your appetite for food. Maybe so, but it will almost surely increase your thirst.\n",
            "\n",
            "It seems that people have been talking about financial modernization for a long time. Indeed, in the short-run it is easy to become discouraged about how often we talk, but how rarely we do anything, about financial modernization. However, if we step back and look over the last twenty years, it seems to me remarkable both how much progress has been achieved and how much the concerns of financial modernization have changed. Two decades ago we still had Regulation Q, the Glass-Steagall Act was widely viewed as requiring a virtual prohibition of combinations of commercial and investment banking, interstate banking and branching were barely fantasies even at the state level, and combinations of banking and insurance were off most peoples radar screens. Today, many of the issues of 20 years ago have, blessedly, been resolved. But some remain, and new ones have inevitably appeared. The contemporary concerns of financial modernization include repeal of Glass-Steagall, expanded insurance activities for banking firms, the entry of insurance and securities firms into banking, the possibility of unlimited mixing of banking and commerce, and ongoing technological changes and financial innovations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tonight I would like to address some aspects of these concerns. I will suggest to you that while financial modernization is still, as it was twenty years ago, a necessity, it is also the case that in an uncertain world characterized by rapid change caution is not a dirty word.\n",
            "\n",
            "Banking and Commerce I will begin with what for me is the easiest topic: banking and commerce.\n",
            "\n",
            "The separation of banking and commerce has a long history in English-speaking countries. Indeed, the policy can be traced back to the founding of the Bank of England in 1694. It appears that commercial firms were concerned that the Banks monetary powers would give it a competitive advantage in mercantile activities if there were no separation of banking and commerce. The young American state governments adopted, at least in principle, this separation of banking and commerce.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, from the beginning the separation of banking and commerce was hardly complete in the U.S. banking system. State governments often saw the granting of bank charters as a way of encouraging capital intensive development projects. As a result, pre-Civil War banks were sometimes engaged in such activities as canal building, railroad construction, and even the development of public water systems.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, from early on the mixing of banking and commerce was a gray area in the United States. This tradition continues to this day. For example, the same individual can own a controlling share of both banking and commercial firms. Perhaps of more interest, a bank holding company may acquire up to 5 percent of the voting shares of any commercial enterprise, as long as the investment does not represent a controlling interest. In addition, the Board has permitted passive investments in commercial firms of up to 25 percent of nonvoting shares, and an investment can be as high as 49 percent if it is made through a small business investment company. Bank holding companies can own 100 percent of the equity of a small business investment company.\n",
            "\n",
            "We could all continue to give many examples, including the ownership of unitary thrifts and specialized, and not-so-specialized, finance companies by commercial firms. Indeed, some observers use these examples to argue that since the United States already has so much mixing of banking and commerce, why not go all the way? In my view, such arguments exaggerate the reality. Despite all the gray areas, I think it is fair to say that to a very substantial extent banking and commerce are essentially separate activities in the United States. Thus, we need to think carefully about whether we want to go even further down the road of combining banking with nonfinancial activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Advocates of unrestricted mixing of banking and commerce make at least four arguments: (1) both banking and commercial firms could more easily diversify their risks, (2) a closely related argument is that such combinations would provide opportunities for synergies in cross-selling, (3) combining banking and commerce could lead to more capital in the banking industry, and (4) mixing banking and commerce would help to solve certain asymmetric information and corporate control problems associated with commercial lending. Time does not permit me to address each of these in detail. Suffice it to say that I find each of them wanting. I can find very little, if any, in our experience as a nation that gives me real confidence about the benefits of combining banking and commerce. And I can find no empirical support for any benefits for combining banking and commerce based on experience abroad.\n",
            "\n",
            "Take risk diversification. Do we really believe that in the day of stock index mutual funds, options on individual stocks, and evolving credit derivatives that any firm must own another in order to diversify its risks in virtually any way it cares to do so? I think not. If diversification of asset return risk were our only goal, financial modernization would be easy. How about synergies in cross-selling? Maybe. But I think we must be skeptical here, because the admittedly weak literature on economies of scope in banking has been hard pressed to find strong evidence of significant synergies even in financial activities, although I think we all believe that there are some.\n",
            "\n",
            "The argument that we need to combine banking and commerce to attract capital to banking seems, well, pretty silly. In a market economy, capital flows to profit opportunities. If banking is viewed as a vibrant and growing industry, it is hard to see why capital will be a problem. Indeed, the banking industry just completed its fifth straight year of record profits, and it is no coincidence that by all measures capital has been flowing into the industry. If it were not profitable, I cannot see why we would want to create a structure to attract capital to banking.\n",
            "\n",
            "The notion that mixing banking and commerce would reduce information costs in bank lending, and would facilitate monitoring and management control by the bank probably has some merit. Banks that hold both a debt and equity stake in a firm would probably be better able to deter excessive risk taking by the other equity holders, and might even have access to better information about the firm. However, the internalization of these principal-agent problems would come at a price: a price that could include less vibrant money and capital markets, an unwarranted expansion of the federal safety net, potentially dangerous conflicts of interest, and excessive concentration of power. On balance, in my view, this is an area where we should be very cautious and where we need far more research before we can come to any definitive conclusions.\n",
            "\n",
            "An additional reason for caution is the necessity of modifying supervisory techniques. I believe that all of the banking agencies can meet the challenges of expanded financial activities. But adding commercial firms before we have digested the financial side of the business could well be a bridge too far. Indeed, I believe that prudent public policy requires that, for this reason alone, we get financial activities right before tackling further combinations of banking and commerce.\n",
            "\n",
            "The thorny banking and commerce problem in financial modernization is that nonbanking financial firms are already affiliated with commercial firms: some from commercial firms creating financial subsidiaries, some from financial firms acquiring nonfinancial businesses. If financial modernization allows all financial firms to affiliate, but prohibits banking and commerce, the pre-existing commercial affiliates of nonbank financial firms would have to be divested to acquire a bank, while banks could enter de novo the new nonbank financial activity without divesting any valuable assets. This is either inequitable or the cost of acquiring a bank, depending on your point of view. But, it is clearly a problem that has to be addressed. The choices are divestiture, grandfathering, long-term phase outs, basket clauses, or combining of banking and commerce. It would seem to me a poor public policy that opened up banking and commerce on pure equity grounds, rather than a disinterested analysis of societal net benefits.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Impact of Technological Change on Bank Risk Management A strong case can be made for focussing bank reform today on the expansion of permissible financial activities. The prohibitions against banking and securities and banking and insurance combinations have always, it seems to me, been difficult to support. Moreover, technological change has simply undermined the traditional distinctions among financial products and services. In a word, the existing prohibitions are anachronistic.\n",
            "\n",
            "One thing has remained consistent: Banks are in the business of taking and managing risk, have always been and always will be. The change that we must cope with is that technology has changed the ways they take risk, while at the same time improving their capability for managing it. This creation and management of risk, like much of recent economic change, would have been impossible without the dramatically lower cost of a unit of computing power. Indeed, before the computer, most of the new bank products of recent years were merely concepts, concepts that could not become operational until they were quantifiable. That's what the computer facilitated: quantification of risk, the necessary prerequisite to price it accurately and manage it effectively.\n",
            "\n",
            "Quantification did not change the fact that banks continue to deal with two very old-fashioned risks: credit risk--will the counterparty perform as promised?--and market risk--will changes in interest rates or other market factors reduce the value of my portfolio? Indeed, the special skills of banks in evaluating and taking credit and market risk is what banks have leveraged in taking part in the financial revolution spawned by the technical revolution. Nonetheless, the nature of the newer products and the relationship with counterparties have meant that risks now manifest themselves in a different way and that banks can modify their risk exposures much more rapidly than ever.\n",
            "\n",
            "Technology and the enhanced ability to capture and use data have changed risk taking and its management in several areas: securitization, credit scoring, and modeling for pricing and capital allocation, to name three. But no finer example of the revolutionary changes made possible by technology can be found than derivatives. Banks and other creators of derivatives can now slice and dice risks associated with a wide spectrum of underlying assets. Derivatives can be used to hedge risk for the bank or its customers. Examples include interest rate swaps designed to make counterparties more comfortable with their interest rate exposures and credit derivatives designed to reduce correlations of risk in a loan portfolio. Of course, either of these instruments can be used to take risk if the holder opts to hold the uncovered exposure, avoiding the cost of acquiring the underlying assets. Moreover, a bank can change its position quickly--limiting a loss, diversifying or hedging a risk, or closing out a position.\n",
            "\n",
            "Derivatives, of course, do more than allow the taking or hedging of risk. They also permit the holders to combine and separate risks to mimic virtually any financial activity. They thus limit what regulators can prohibit, blur distinctions between instruments regulated by different regulators, and virtually eliminate functional and other distinctions among commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Supervising the Future Financial Services Holding Company When it comes to considering how technology and new products have affected supervision--especially of the future financial services holding company, with its wider powers--I must begin by repeating an earlier comment: Banking organizations are still in the risk business--taking it, managing it, profiting from it, and when they make the wrong decision or have bad luck, bearing losses and perhaps even failing. And the basic risks still are credit and market risks. The same expertise banks used for old-fashioned loans and their funding is still what they do for derivatives, securitizations, and credit scoring.\n",
            "\n",
            "That having been said, however, one must quickly add that the new instruments and procedures raise real questions about both managing and supervising risk by instruments and/or by legal entity. Banking organizations are doing so less and less, and as a result supervisors are following suit. Banking organizations have increasingly centralized risk management at the parent as a necessity because the credit decisions cross legal entities and certainly cross instruments. The new technology has already created a supervisory imperative that financial modernization--with its new permissible activities--can only accelerate: the need to evaluate risk policies and positions centrally-- most likely by one supervisor, sharing information with all legal entity regulators.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, I must say, it is not clear to me precisely what this technology implies for the legal entity regulators. If units of an organization, through combinations of puts and calls, can simulate all the attributes of a security, or even most of the risks and returns of certain businesses, what does the term functional regulator mean? Historically, when a legal entity--a unit of an organization--was the only vehicle for participating in a certain function, the idea of separating regulators by functions was consistent with legal form. It is increasingly less so when a synthetic asset can be created with the same risk and return characteristics of the underlying asset.\n",
            "\n",
            "Or, how comfortable should the individual regulator feel if a hedge involves as counterparties two legal entities in the same failing organization? Will the regulator of unit A let the gains booked in his unit offset losses in unit B, regulated by another entity? Can he do so under the law? If the answer to either question is no, what good is such a hedge at a failing organization? Even without complicating the issue by failure, how does the regulator of the unit booking the loss on the hedge feel about the hedge, no matter how desirable the hedge is for the whole organization?\n",
            "\n",
            "The new reality, it seems to me, is that supervisors have to supervise risk and not instruments or entities. And that implies either that we keep organizations in old-fashioned straight-jackets and permit no new activities--a strategy which the market and technology has already undermined--or we recognize that, over time, specialized regulators of banks, of securities firms, of even insurance companies--are going to have to find a new paradigm.\n",
            "\n",
            "We are, I believe, groping toward that future supervisory structure. At its center will be an evaluation of risk management procedures and policies. Historically, bank holding company supervision has dealt with an organization that was overwhelmingly a bank, and until Section 20s, whose affiliates were engaged in businesses that could be conducted within the bank. The supervisory approach was, not surprisingly, to apply bank-like supervision to the affiliates. The designers of financial modernization legislation and the holding company or umbrella supervisor must consider how to change that approach as bank affiliates increasingly are engaged in businesses not permitted to banks, and possibly even subject to regulation by a nonbank regulator. At a minimum, it is desirable to avoid redundant regulation. More basically, the necessarily intrusive supervision of banks that comes with the safety net should not be extended to these new activities. In part, such supervision would reduce efficiency and flexibility. In part, it would be unnecessary. And, in larger part, it could create a moral hazard by fostering the wrong impression that a bank supervisor has confirmed the strength of the supervised affiliate. Thus, the focus of holding company supervision, as I noted, should be evaluation of risk management policies and procedures for the organization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Safety Net Subsidies and Organizational Form Beyond regulatory structure, financial modernization--the linkage of banks to a wider range of financial activities--also raises organizational structure issues. This issue is closely linked to the subsidy provided by the federal safety net, a much discussed topic in recent weeks. By the safety net I mean deposit insurance, and access to both the Federal Reserve discount window and the Feds payment system. While many of the questions associated with this topic are subtle and complex, I believe that some of the more basic issues regarding the safety net subsidy can be understood using straightforward economic reasoning. Unfortunately, much of the debate thus far has tended to be more obscure than it needs to be.\n",
            "\n",
            "Take, for example, the question of whether a subsidy exists. Most observers agree that there is a gross subsidy, and that the real issue is whether there is a subsidy net of regulatory costs. But here the discussion often seems to get confused. To me, it is critical at this point to distinguish clearly between the concepts of total benefits, total costs, and marginal benefits and marginal costs. We all know, at least those of us with some training in economics should know, that profit maximizing firms will equate marginal benefits with marginal costs. Applied to the subsidy debate, this principle implies that in equilibrium a profit maximizing bank should set the marginal benefits of the subsidy equal to its marginal costs. In other words, rational firms should drive the net marginal benefit of the subsidy to zero. Importantly, this implies that, at the margin, it may be very difficult to actually observe the subsidy. I suspect that this goes a long way toward explaining why efforts to estimate the marginal value of the subsidy have, to date, proved less than successful.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even though rational firms equate marginal benefits and marginal costs, they clearly do not equate total benefits and total costs. Indeed, standard microeconomic theory says that in a competitive equilibrium total benefits should exceed total costs. Again applying this concept to the subsidy debate, at any individual, profit maximizing bank the total benefits of the subsidy should exceed the subsidys total costs, even though the subsidys marginal net benefit is zero. This total net benefit allows the banking industry to be larger, and perhaps riskier, than it would otherwise be. The fact that we do not observe banks voluntarily giving up their charters suggests that it may well be that the safety nets total benefits exceed its total costs, even if the value of the net marginal subsidy is zero.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consider another point that derives from the distinction between total and marginal benefits. Today, we would expect banks to be maximizing their total net benefits from the subsidy using all of the activities in which they are capable of engaging. Now consider what a rational bank will do if given a new opportunity, say expanded securities powers, to maximize profit. Wouldn't we expect the bank to once again equate marginal benefits with marginal costs, including the marginal benefits and costs of the safety net subsidy? But in the resultant new equilibrium, where the value of the net marginal subsidy is again zero, would the total net benefits of the subsidy be the same as in the previous, more constrained equilibrium? Clearly the answer is no. We would expect total net benefits to be larger, and the banking industry to be larger, as it rationally sought to fully exploit the new opportunities to make profits and exploit the subsidy. Rather than focus on measuring how large the net subsidy is today, perhaps the more appropriate focus of our discussion should be on the more speculative question of how the expansion of bank powers would enhance the value of the safety net subsidy, and what would be the characteristics of the resulting competitive relationships.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another key idea to keep in mind when thinking about the value of the safety net subsidy is that we would fully expect the value of the subsidy to vary quite significantly across banks and over time. The safety net subsidy can be thought of as deriving primarily from the confidence that investors have in the belief that banks will be supported in times of financial crisis. This confidence is reflected in lower total and marginal costs of funding for banks, including lower capital requirements than otherwise would be the case. The economic value of this confidence is almost surely rather low at very healthy banks during good economic times. However, the value can be very much greater for any bank in financial distress, and can skyrocket in times of systemic financial crisis. As Chairman Greenspan noted in congressional testimony recently:\n",
            "\n",
            "What was it worth in the late 1980s and early 1990s for a bank with a troubled loan portfolio to have deposit liabilities guaranteed by the FDIC, to be assured that it could turn illiquid to liquid assets at once through the Federal Reserve discount window, and to tell its customers that payment transfers would be settled on a riskless Federal Reserve Bank? For many, it was worth not basis points but percentage points. For some, it meant the difference between survival and failure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Empirical research on the option value of deposit insurance supports the point I am trying to make. Estimates of the option value of deposit insurance, while subject to many caveats, show that riskier banks have considerably higher option values.\n",
            "\n",
            "What does all of this mean for the appropriate organizational form that future banking organizations should take? Now that is, I need not tell this audience, a complicated question! But I think the basic questions that we must answer are clear. First, assuming that one of the goals of public policy is to not expand the safety net subsidy, what organizational form minimizes the chances of such an expansion? Second, assuming that another goal of public policy is to limit the opportunities for banks to exploit the moral hazard incentives inherent to the safety net, what organizational form best ensures the safety and soundness of banks?\n",
            "\n",
            "The holding company organizational structure has a proven track record of helping to achieve both of these public policy goals. Indeed, years before I joined the Board, previous Boards worked hard at convincing market participants that there is a clear distinction, in terms of access to the safety net, between a bank and its affiliates. Market practice supports the view that we have achieved considerable success at making this distinction. To me, it seems not only logical, but highly desirable that we should build on this success as we continue to modernize our banking and financial system.\n",
            "\n",
            "When thinking about this issue, it is instructive to understand that in recent years bank holding companies have in fact tended to move activities from the holding company back into the bank. These activities had originally been put in the holding company to avoid geographic and similar restrictions. As a result of this movement back into the bank, the nonbank assets held by holding companies, excluding the assets of Section 20 securities subsidiaries, have declined by almost 50 percent over the last decade to 5.2 percent of consolidated bank holding company assets. When asked why activities are being moved back into the bank, bankers often say that it is to take advantage of the lower funding costs available at the bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "One final point on this issue. It is certainly true that prudent managements of banking organizations will weigh all the relevant factors, including the value of the safety net, when deciding on the best organizational structure for their firm. However, the key point to remember is that those organizations that stand to gain the most from the safety net in times of crisis--those with the highest net subsidy and the strongest incentives to take excessive risks--are the most likely both to prefer and to take advantage of any organizational structures that allow the greatest net subsidy. These are also the organizations that are most likely to distort competitive relationships and expose taxpayers to considerable risk. Thus, while allowing organizations a choice of organizational structure certainly increases bank managements flexibility, it is not clear that allowing such choice serves the public interest.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion In closing, let me return to where I began. Financial modernization is a process that must and will continue. But in the course of embracing and adapting to the future we must take care to retain what is of value in the past, and be careful that critical public policy goals are achieved. The separation of banking and commerce is an area where we should be particularly cautious. Once we have mastered the art and science of supervising full service financial organizations, then perhaps we should consider further combining banking and commerce. Technological change and financial innovation are combining to change profoundly the way financial institutions measure, take, and manage risk. These require that financial supervisors also adapt, and we need to move forward in this endeavor. The development of full service financial organizations only reinforces the imperatives to do so. When designing a system that maintains bank safety and soundness and constrains extension of the safety net, organizational structure is not irrelevant. Here again it seems prudent that we should be cautious, and build on structures that have proven their worth.\n",
            "\n",
            "I am confident that a proper balance can be achieved between our sometimes conflicting and always complex goals. Indeed, I look forward to trying to contribute to the ongoing discussion and resolution of the challenges of financial modernization. Thank you.\n",

            "The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society\n",
            "\n",
            "Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I am especially pleased to accept AEI's Francis Boyer Award for 1996 and be listed with so many of my friends and former associates. In my lecture this evening I want to give some personal perspectives on central banking and, consequently, I shall be speaking only for myself.\n",
            "\n",
            "William Jennings Bryan reportedly mesmerized the Democratic Convention of 1896 with his memorable \". . . you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\" His utterances underscored the profoundly divisive role of money in his time--a divisiveness that remains apparent today. Bryan was arguing for monetizing silver at an above-market price in order to expand the money supply. The presumed consequences would have been an increase in product prices and an accompanying shift in the value of net claims on future wealth from the \"monied interests\" of the East to the indebted farmers of the West who would arguably be able to pay off their obligations with cheaper money.\n",
            "\n",
            "The debates, before and since, over the issue of our money standard have mirrored the deliberations on the manner in which we have chosen to govern ourselves, and, perhaps more fundamentally, debates on the basic values that should govern our society.\n",
            "\n",
            "For, at root, money--serving as a store of value and medium of exchange--is the lubricant that enables a society to organize itself to achieve economic progress. The ability to store the fruits of one's labor for future consumption is necessary for the accumulation of capital, the spread of technological advances and, as a consequence, rising standards of living.\n",
            "\n",
            "Clearly in this context, the general price level, that is, the average exchange rate for money against all goods and services, and how it changes over time, plays a profoundly important role in any society, because it influences the nature and scope of our economic and social relationships over time.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is, thus, no wonder that we at the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, and ultimate guardian of the purchasing power of our money, are subject to unending scrutiny. Indeed, it would be folly were it otherwise.\n",
            "\n",
            "A central bank in a democratic society is a magnet for many of the tensions that such a society confronts. Any institution that can affect the purchasing power of the currency is perceived as potentially affecting the level and distribution of wealth among the participants of that society, hardly an inconsequential issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not surprisingly, the evolution of central banking in this nation has been driven by such concerns. The experiences with paper money during the Revolutionary War were decidedly inauspicious. \"Not worth a Continental\" was scarcely the epithet one would wish on a medium of exchange. This moved Alexander Hamilton, with some controversy, to press for legislation that established the soundness of the credit of the United States by assuming, and ultimately repaying, the war debts not only of the fledgling federal government, but of the states as well. Equally controversial was the chartering of the First Bank of the United States, which, although it had few functions of a modern central bank, was nonetheless believed to be a significant threat to states rights and the Constitution itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although majority controlled by private interests, the Bank engaged in actions perceived to shift power to the federal government. Such a shift was thought of by many as a fundamental threat to the new democracy, and an essential element of what was feared to be a Hamilton plan to re-establish a powerful aristocracy. The First Bank--and especially its successor Second Bank of the United States--endeavored to restrict state bank credit expansion when it appeared inordinate, by gathering bank notes and tendering them for specie. This reduced the reserve base and the ability of the fledgling American banking system to expand credit. The issue of states' rights and concern about the power of the central government reflected the free wheeling individualism of that time. The Second Bank was a major issue of the election of 1832. Earlier in that year, President Andrew Jackson had vetoed the bill to extend its charter, and the election became a referendum on his veto. The outcome was a resounding victory for Jackson and the death knell for the Bank.\n",
            "\n",
            "It has not been easy, however, to separate often seemingly conflicting threads in the debate between advocates of state powers over money and those seeking a national role. When Andrew Jackson vetoed the charter renewal of the Second Bank of the United States, for example, he argued for the severing of the grip on the economy of easterners and especially foreigners, who owned a significant stock interest in the bank. Ironically, by helping to create what was perceived to be an unstable currency, he set the stage for the later development of a full-fledged gold standard, the institution that Bryan railed against in 1896 from much the same populist philosophical base as Jackson.\n",
            "\n",
            "After the Civil War, redemption of the paper greenbacks issued during the war brought an era of a gold-standard-induced deflation, which, while it may not have thwarted the impressive advance of industrialization, was seen by many as suppressing credit availability for the rural interests of the nation, which were still a majority. The general price level declined for more than two decades, which meant borrowers were paying off their loans in more expensive dollars than those they borrowed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not surprisingly, mounting pressures developed for reform, with Bryan bearing the standard for subsidized silver coinage, that is, free silver. Though Bryan lost to McKinley in 1896 (and again in 1900), the rural-based pressures for a more elastic currency did not diminish and ultimately were reflected, in part, in the creation of the Federal Reserve.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nonetheless, many of the proponents of banking reform in the 1890s, and in the aftermath of the Panic of 1907, were suspicious of creating a central bank. In very large measure, those concerns underlay the various threads of reform that were joined together in the design and creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. Its founding followed a prolonged debate on the balance of power between the interests of the New York money center banks and the rest of the nation, still largely rural. The compromise that resulted from that debate created twelve regional Reserve Banks with a Washington presence vested with a Federal Reserve Board. Its purpose was to \"furnish an elastic currency, . . . to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes.\" Monetary policy as we know it today, was not among the \"other purposes.\" That evolved largely by accident in the 1920s.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even with a central bank, the gold standard was still the dominant constraint on the issuance of paper currency and the expansion of bank deposits. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve was to play a minor role in affecting the purchasing power of the currency for many years to come.\n",
            "\n",
            "The world changed markedly with the advent of the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the evisceration of the gold standard. The upheaval, and still festering fear of New York \"monied interests,\" engendered the Banking Acts of 1933 and more importantly of 1935, which vested more of the Federal Reserve's authority with the Board of Governors in Washington. During World War II, and through 1951, however, monetary policy was effectively subservient to the interests of the Treasury, which sought access to low-cost credit. With the so-called Federal Reserve-Treasury Accord of 1951, the Federal Reserve began to develop its current degree of independence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although in the 1950s and early 1960s there were short-lived bouts of inflation that caused momentary concern about sustained increases in the price level, these events did little to shake the conviction of most that America's economic and financial structure would indefinitely and effectively contain any inflationary forces. This prescription certainly seems to have been reflected in the low inflation premium then embedded in long-term bonds.\n",
            "\n",
            "That this view was profoundly wrong soon became apparent. The 1970s saw inflation and unemployment simultaneously at relatively elevated levels for some time. The notion that this could occur was nowhere to be found in the conventional wisdom of the economic policy philosophy that developed out of the Keynesian revolution of the 1930s and its subsequent empirical applications. Moreover, these models embodied the view that aggregate demand expansion, from almost any level, would permanently create new jobs. When that expansion carried the economy beyond \"full employment\" there would be a cost in terms of higher inflation--but only a one-time increase in inflation, so that there existed a permanent trade off between sustainable levels of inflation and employment.\n",
            "\n",
            "The stagflation of the 1970s required a thorough conceptual overhaul of economic thinking and policymaking. Monetarism, and new insights into the effects of anticipatory expectations on economic activity and price setting, competed strongly against the traditional Keynesianism. Gradually the power of state intervention to achieve particular economic outcomes came to be seen as much more limited. A consensus gradually emerged in the late 1970s that inflation destroyed jobs, or at least could not create them.\n",
            "\n",
            "This view has become particularly evident in the communiques that have emanated from the high-level international gatherings of the past quarter century. That inflation could reduce employment was a highly controversial subject in the mid-1970s when introduced into communique language drafts. At the meetings I attended as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, the notion invariably induced extended debates. Today in similar communiques such language is accepted boiler plate and rarely the focus of discussion. This shift in attitudes and understanding provided political support in 1980 and thereafter for the type of monetary policy required to rebalance the economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Despite waxing and waning over the decades, a deep-seated tension still exists over government's role as an economic policymaker. This tension is evident in Congressional debates, campaign rhetoric, and our ubiquitous talk shows.\n",
            "\n",
            "It should not be a surprise that the very same ambiguities and conflicts that characterize the rest of our political life have their reflection in the nation's current view of its central bank, the Federal Reserve. With regard to monetary policy, the view--or at least the suspicion--still persists in some quarters that an activist, expansionary policy could yield dividends in terms of permanently higher output and employment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nonetheless, there is a grudging acceptance of the degree of independence afforded our institution, and an awareness that unless we are free of the appropriations process that our independence could be compromised. It is generally recognized and appreciated that if the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions were subject to Congressional or Presidential override, short-term political forces would soon dominate. The clear political preference for lower interest rates would unleash inflationary forces, inflicting severe damage on our economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Notwithstanding, the central bank has not been immune from the suspicion and lack of respect that has come to afflict virtually all institutions in our society since the traumas of Vietnam, Watergate, and the destabilizing inflation in the 1970s.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Federal Reserve's most important mission, of course, is monetary policy. I wish I could say that there is a bound volume of immutable instructions on my desk on how effectively to implement policy to achieve our goals of maximum employment, sustainable economic growth, and price stability. Instead, we have to deal with a dynamic, continuously evolving economy whose structure appears to change from business cycle to business cycle, an issue I shall return to shortly.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because monetary policy works with a lag, we need to be forward looking, taking actions to forestall imbalances that may not be visible for many months. There is no alternative to basing actions on forecasts, at least implicitly. It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is evident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the underlying forces acting on the economy shift. This process is not easy to get right at all times, and it is often difficult to convey to the American people, whose support is essential to our mission.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because the Fed is perceived as being capable of significantly affecting the lives of all Americans, that we should be subject to constant scrutiny should not come as any surprise. Indeed, speaking as a citizen, and not Fed Chairman, I would be concerned were it otherwise. Our monetary policy independence is conditional on pursuing policies that are broadly acceptable to the American people and their representatives in the Congress.\n",
            "\n",
            "Augmenting concerns about the Federal Reserve is the perception that we are a secretive organization, operating behind closed doors, not always in the interests of the nation as a whole. This is regrettable, and we continuously strive to alter this misperception.\n",
            "\n",
            "If we are to maintain the confidence of the American people, it is vitally important that, excepting the certain areas where the premature release of information could frustrate our legislated mission, the Fed must be as transparent as any agency of government. It cannot be acceptable in a democratic society that a group of unelected individuals are vested with important responsibilities, without being open to full public scrutiny and accountability.\n",
            "\n",
            "To be sure, if we are to carry out effectively the monetary policy mission the Congress has delegated to us, there are certain Federal Reserve deliberations that have to remain confidential for a period of time. To open up our debates on monetary policy fully to immediate disclosure would unsettle financial markets and constrain our discussions in a manner that would undercut our ability to function. Nonetheless, we continue to look for ways to expand the flow of information to the public without compromising our deliberations and purposes. We have recently commenced to announce all policy actions immediately (federal funds rate changes as well as discount rate changes) and have expanded the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee.\n",
            "\n",
            "For many years, the Federal Reserve has maintained what we trust is a highly sophisticated day-by-day, near real-time, evaluation of the American economy and, where relevant, of foreign economies as well. We are able, partly through our twelve Reserve Banks, to monitor continuously developments in the real world. The information supplied about local conditions by the directors of the Reserve Banks has been frequently useful in identifying emerging national trends and in evaluating their underlying regional implications.\n",
            "\n",
            "The issues with which we are confronted differ in urgency over time. Inflation concerns were not a dominant factor in economic forecasting in the 1950s and early 1960s, for example. Since the late 1970s, however, such concerns have become an important element in policymaking. More recently inflation has been low, but its future course remains uncertain. The development of comfortable product, but tight labor, markets has been a crucial factor in short-term economic forecasts of recent months--a phenomenon for which there is scant historic precedent.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is, regrettably, no simple model of the American economy that can effectively explain the levels of output, employment, and inflation. In principle, there may be some unbelievably complex set of equations that does that. But we have not been able to find them, and do not believe anyone else has either.\n",
            "\n",
            "Consequently, we are led, of necessity, to employ ad hoc partial models and intensive informative analysis to aid in evaluating economic developments and implementing policy. There is no alternative to this, though we continuously seek to enhance our knowledge to match the ever growing complexity of the world economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "At different times in our history a varying set of simple indicators seemed successfully to summarize the state of monetary policy and its relationship to the economy. Thus, during the decades of the 1970s and 1980s, trends in money supply, first M1, then M2, were useful guides. We could convey the thrust of our policy with money supply targets, though we felt free to deviate from those targets for good reason. This presumably helped the Congress, after the fact, to monitor our contribution to the performance of the economy. I should add that during this period we maintained a fully detailed analysis of the economy, in part, to make sure that money supply was still emitting reliable signals about the state of the economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, money supply trends veered off path several years ago as a useful summary of the overall economy. Thus, to keep the Congress informed on what we are doing, we have been required to explain the full complexity of the substance of our deliberations, and how we see economic relationships and evolving trends.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are some indications that the money demand relationships to interest rates and income may be coming back on track. It is too soon to tell, and in any event we can not in the future expect to rely a great deal on money supply in making monetary policy. Still, if money growth is better behaved, it would be helpful in the conduct of policy and in our communications with the Congress and the public. In the absence of simple, summary indicators, we will continue our detailed evaluation of economic developments. As we seek price stability and maximum sustainable growth, the changing economic structures constantly present more analytic challenges.\n",
            "\n",
            "I doubt the tasks will become any easier for the Federal Reserve as we move into the twenty-first century. The Congress willing, we will remain as the guardian of the purchasing power of the dollar. But one factor that will continue to complicate that task is the increasing difficulty of pinning down the notion of what constitutes a stable general price level.\n",
            "\n",
            "When industrial product was the centerpiece of the economy during the first two-thirds of this century, our overall price indexes served us well. Pricing a pound of electrolytic copper presented few definitional problems. The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or a linear yard of cotton broad woven fabrics, could be reasonably compared over a period of years.\n",
            "\n",
            "But as the century draws to a close, the simple notion of price has turned decidedly ambiguous. What is the price of a unit of software or a legal opinion? How does one evaluate the price change of a cataract operation over a ten-year period when the nature of the procedure and its impact on the patient changes so radically. Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial and real implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?\n",
            "\n",
            "So long as individuals make contractual arrangements for future payments valued in dollars, there must be a presumption on the part of those involved in the transaction about the future purchasing power of money. No matter how complex individual products become, there will always be some general sense of the purchasing power of money both across time and across goods and services. Hence, we must assume that embodied in all products is some unit of output and hence of price that is recognizable to producers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions. Doubtless, we will develop new techniques of price measurement to unearth them as the years go on. It is crucial that we do, for inflation can destabilize an economy even if faulty price indexes fail to reveal it.\n",
            "\n",
            "But where do we draw the line on what prices matter? Certainly prices of goods and services now being produced--our basic measure of inflation--matter. But what about futures prices or more importantly prices of claims on future goods and services, like equities, real estate, or other earning assets? Are stability of these prices essential to the stability of the economy?\n",
            "\n",
            "Clearly, sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future, and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of stocks and other earning assets. We can see that in the inverse relationship exhibited by price/earnings ratios and the rate of inflation in the past. But how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade? And how do we factor that assessment into monetary policy? We as central bankers need not be concerned if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real economy, its production, jobs, and price stability. Indeed, the sharp stock market break of 1987 had few negative consequences for the economy. But we should not underestimate or become complacent about the complexity of the interactions of asset markets and the economy. Thus, evaluating shifts in balance sheets generally, and in asset prices particularly, must be an integral part of the development of monetary policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The public examination of Federal Reserve actions extends well beyond our stewardship of monetary policy. Our overall management of the Federal Reserve System should, and does, come under considerable scrutiny by the Congress. Since we expend unappropriated taxpayer funds, we have an especial obligation to be prudent and efficient with the use of those funds. I am not particularly concerned about the one-third of our annual $2 billion budget that is expended to provide financial services to the private sector in competition with other providers. Such services include the clearing of checks, the operation of the Fedwire system, and the processing of automated clearing house payments. We are reimbursed for those services, and at competitive prices still make a reasonable profit for the Treasury. If we became inefficient and uncompetitive, we would be priced out of the market, and eventually out of that line of business.\n",
            "\n",
            "An additional one-sixth of our expenses are for providing services to the Treasury and other agencies of government for which we are subject to reimbursement with appropriated funds. For the remainder, which mainly covers monetary policy, supervision and regulation of banks, and currency operations, we have to be especially diligent, for there is no external arbiter.\n",
            "\n",
            "The rapidly changing technologies of recent years are pressing us to review thoroughly our structure and operations. We have already engaged in major consolidations of operations when such consolidations have been made cost effective by the newer technologies. Although in my experience the Federal Reserve System has been responsible, efficient, and has performed well, the rapidly changing external environment frequently requires us to rethink our role and mission. Even where we can be competitive, it is not the role of a government agency, especially one vested with an unsurpassable credit rating, to seek out all available market opportunities. Accordingly, where specific priced services have become effectively and competitively provided by private sector suppliers, the Federal Reserve needs to reassess whether the extent of our participation in those services fulfills a reasonable public purpose. There are, of course, certain services that the Congress has, and will in the future, deem appropriate for us to subsidize. But these areas presumably will remain circumscribed.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a step in our periodic reassessment, a special committee of Federal Reserve Board governors and Reserve Bank presidents has been set up to review our priced services operations and other Systemwide activities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another step has been to engage outside accounting firms to audit the Federal Reserve Board and the twelve Reserve Banks. We had been quite satisfied with the Board as general auditor of the Reserve Banks since 1914. But the range of activities and the reach of the Federal Reserve in recent years requires us to address the perception that we are auditing ourselves without the full arm's length relationship deemed appropriate in today's environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, the substantial changes under way in bank risk management are pressing us to continuously alter our modes of supervision and regulation to keep them as effective and efficient as possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most importantly, all of our recent initiatives, especially the strengthening of the payments system and supervision, are critical to a central mission of the Federal Reserve, to maintain financial stability and reduce and contain systemic risks. This mission is an extension of our monetary policy. Our country can not enjoy the long-run \"maximum employment and stable prices\" objectives we are given for monetary policy if the financial system is unstable. In this regard, the successes that most please us are not so much the visible problems that we solve, but rather all the potential crises that could have happened, but didn't.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doubtless, the most important defense against such crises is prevention. Recent mini-crises have identified the rapidly mushrooming payments system as the most vulnerable area of potential danger. We have no tolerance for error in our electronic payment systems. Like a breakdown in an electric power grid, small mishaps create large problems. Consequently, we have endeavored in recent years, as the demands on our system have escalated (we clear $1-1/2 trillion a day on Fedwire), to build in significant safety redundancies. This has been costly in terms of equipment and buildings.\n",
            "\n",
            "Along with our other central bank colleagues, we are always looking for ways to reduce the risks that the failure of a single institution will ricochet around the world, shutting down much of the world payments system, and significantly undermining the world's economies. Accordingly, we are endeavoring to get as close to a real time transaction, clearing, and settlement system as possible. This would sharply reduce financial float and the risk of breakdown. Meaningful progress has already been made in this direction.\n",
            "\n",
            "This evening I have tried to put current central banking issues in historical context. Monetary arrangements, including central banks, naturally are under constant scrutiny and criticism. This is no less true of the Federal Reserve in 1996 than of the gold standard in 1896. Central banks need to respond patiently and responsibly to the commentary, and we need to adapt to changing circumstances in markets and the economy.\n",
            "\n",
            "A democratic society requires a stable and effectively functioning economy. I trust that we and our successors at the Federal Reserve will be important contributors to that end.\n",
